## Evidence Examples

Include 1–3 artifacts that support a theme. Screenshots or links are fine. Add a caption.

## Team Action Plan (3 actions)

Each action: owner, timeframe, and a plain recognition cue so you can tell it's working.

## Individual Sections

Create one subsection per student. Keep it 0.5-1 page each. Cover 1-2 wins, 1-2 gaps, 2 measurable improvement commitments, and 1 risk + mitigation plan.

## Optional Appendix

Extra screenshots, quoted snippets, links, or notes you don’t want in the main flow.
