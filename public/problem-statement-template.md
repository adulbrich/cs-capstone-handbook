# Problem Statement

## One-Sentence Problem Statement

State who is affected, what breaks, where/when it occurs, and why it matters. Avoid solution language.

## Context & Affected Users/Roles

- Role 1: [1–2 lines on context/pain]
- Role 2: [1–2 lines on context/pain]
[Add more as needed]

## Evidence Snapshot

3-5 bullets

- [Timestamp — Role] Key insight 1
- [Timestamp — Role] Key insight 2
- [Timestamp — Role] Key insight 3

Redact PII; keep concise

## Framing Lenses

Per teammate

- **Lens A (e.g., 5 Whys)** — [1 short paragraph: main finding]
- **Lens B (e.g., Is/Is-Not)** — [finding]
- **Lens C (e.g., JTBD forces / HMW / fishbone / workflow-as-is)** — [finding]

## Current vs. Ideal

Choose one.

**Option A — Current Workflow & Pain Points:**  
[Short bullet flow + where pain occurs]  
**OR**  
**Option B — Before/After Scenario:**  
**Before:** [user’s current experience]  
**After:** [what “better” looks like without naming a solution]

## Measurable Success Criteria

2-4 bullets

- SC-1: [Metric/threshold, e.g., “Reduce average X from A to ≤ B (P95 ≤ T)”]
- SC-2: [Binary/ratio target, e.g., “Task success ≥ Y% in Z context”]
- SC-3: [Optional]

## Constraints & Assumptions; Non-Goals

- **Constraints:** [tech/policy/time/access limits]
- **Assumptions:** [what must be true]
- **Non-Goals:** [out-of-scope items]

## Partner Feedback & Edits

- Meeting date: [YYYY-MM-DD] — [decisions, owners]
- Edits made: [what changed in sections 1–7]

## Traceability Mini-Table

| Partner Goal | Problem Facet | Success Criterion ID |
|---|---|---|
| G1: [goal] | F1: [facet] | SC-1 |
| G2: [goal] | F2: [facet] | SC-2 |

## Change Log

- [YYYY-MM-DD] Initial draft.
- [YYYY-MM-DD] Updated after partner review: [brief note].
- [YYYY-MM-DD] [Further edits]

## Optional

### Diagram (Fishbone / Is-Is Not / JTBD timeline)

Paste image, ASCII diagram, or public link

### Top Risks

Maximum 2 bullets

- R1: [risk] — Trigger: [X]; Mitigation: [Y]
- R2: [risk] — Trigger: [X]; Mitigation: [Y]

### One-Slide Elevator Pitch

[Problem in 2–3 bullets + one metric that matters
