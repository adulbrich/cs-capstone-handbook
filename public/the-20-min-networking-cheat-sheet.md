# The 20-Minute Networking Meeting (Graduate Edition) — Cheat Sheet

*Based on Nathan A. Perez’s book. Use this to run structured, respectful networking meetings that build authentic professional relationships.*

## Purpose

Networking isn’t begging for a job — it’s about **building authentic professional relationships**. Most jobs are hidden and come from the “invisible job market.” The 20-minute meeting is a structured, respectful way to connect and learn from professionals.

## Core Principles

- Networking ≠ Job Asking: It’s about advice, insight, and connection.
- Respect Their Time: Keep it short (20 minutes).
- Preparation is Everything: Research before meeting.
- Reciprocity: Always think how you can provide value back.
- Follow-Up: This is where real relationships form.

## Structure

1. **First Impression (2 min)** — Greeting, gratitude, small talk, professionalism.
2. **Overview (1 min)** — 30–60 sec intro: who you are, what you’re aiming for.
3. **Discussion (12-15 min)** — Ask prepared, open-ended questions; listen actively.
4. **Ending (2 min)** — Thank them, ask for referrals, respect time.
5. **Follow-Up (after)** — Thank-you email, LinkedIn connection, keep track.

## Do’s & Don’ts

**Do**: Be punctual, ask insightful questions, show curiosity, express gratitude.
**Don’t**: Treat it like a job interview, overstay, talk only about yourself, skip follow-up.

## Tools & Exercises

- Readiness Exercise: Ensure preparation before scheduling.
- One-Minute Overview Planner: Practice concise intros.
- Email Planner: Craft outreach messages.
- Follow-Up Tracker: Log contacts, maintain momentum.

## Key Takeaways

- Networking = relationships, not transactions.
- 20-min framework = easy + respectful.
- Consistency builds a network that generates opportunities and growth.
