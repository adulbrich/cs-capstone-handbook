# Walking Skeleton Prototype

## RUN

Exact commands/steps to reproduce the demo locally OR verify via staging. Include env & tooling versions only if essential. 5–8 lines.

## CI HEALTH

Include the latest green default-branch run and branch protection proof. 1 screenshot + 1 line.

## TESTS

Provide either an automated happy-path test report + brief coverage OR a deterministic demo script + expected output. 1 screenshot + 1 line.

## QUALITY

Linter/formatter output from the same build; name the config used. 1 screenshot + 1 line.

## CODE STRUCTURE

Show top-level file/folder tree (1–2 levels) OR an interface stub/API schema. No business logic required. 1 small screenshot.

## AUTHORSHIP

Each member lists authored changes. Approvals alone don’t count. Use PR IDs or change tickets. Small table.

## ACCESS (optional)

If staging is private, provide time-boxed credentials or reviewer instructions. Remove/redact after grading. 1–2 lines.

## ATTN (optional)

Note constraints (e.g., air-gapped build) and what logs/outputs you’ve provided instead. 1–2 lines.
