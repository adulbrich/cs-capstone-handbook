Hi <Partner/Mentor Name>,

We’re the <Project Name> team in OSU CS Capstone. We’d love to introduce ourselves and schedule a first meeting.

- <Student A> – <1-line intro: interests/skills/why this project>
- <Student B> – <1-line intro>
- <Student C> – <1-line intro>
- <Student D> – <1-line intro>

To find a time, please choose any slot that works for you: <When2Meet or Calendly link>.

Preferred channel for follow-ups: <Teams/Slack/Email/other>. <Name> will drive the next step and send the calendar invite.

A few quick questions to help us prepare:

1. Are there must-read docs or environments we should access beforehand?
2. What’s the preferred meeting cadence and communication channel?
3. Any early constraints (timeline, tech stack, data access) we should note?
4. Is there a “definition of success” you’d like us to target for the next checkpoint?

Thank you — we’re looking forward to collaborating!

Best,

<Your Name> (on behalf of Team <Project Name>)
