# Team Charter & Working Agreement

## How We Work

Write one–two sentences each for: roles, decision rule (e.g., simple majority), meeting cadence, core tools, risks, and escalation path.

## Conflict and Accountability

Define triggers, a brief 3-step resolution path, and what evidence you’ll use (PRs/reviews/attendance).

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Before merge:

- tests pass,
- one approving review,
- docs updated if behavior changes,
- CI job name that enforces tests/lint.

## Inclusion Norms

Three (3) concrete things you’ll do so everyone participates (e.g., rotating note taker, time-boxed turns, camera-optional).

## Ownership & Review Date

Put an owner next to each section and a “review-by” date.
