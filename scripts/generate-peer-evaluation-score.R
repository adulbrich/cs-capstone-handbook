### Question 3
# Take 100 points, and divide them among the N team members, including yourself. Give points based on your opinion of what proportion of the credit each member deserves. You may consider quality and quantity of contributions, team-player attitude, and/or any aspects that you feel are relevant. You must give yourself at least 100/N points, whether you honestly feel you deserve them or not. (This is to avoid an unrealistic “self-incrimination” requirement.)
