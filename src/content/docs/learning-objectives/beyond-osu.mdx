"Beyond OSU is an institutional approach that provides an infrastructure where career readiness and development are intentionally built in to the student experience. Through career preparation and experiences, all students will develop skills and gain connections to help them achieve their goals."[^1]

## Learning Outcomes

Graduates of the program will have an ability to:[^2]

1. Illustrate how their OSU and related experiences connect to career readiness and career advancement skills. 
2. Apply life-long career development concepts through the creation of career relevant artifacts. 
3. Apply career development concepts to relevant artifacts from engagement in a career related experience or activity.

The CS Capstone series focuses on the third learning outcome, as students will engage in a career-related experience through their project work. This includes applying career development concepts to their project artifacts, such as documentation, design specifications, and other deliverables.
