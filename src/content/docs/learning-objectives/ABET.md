The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is a nonprofit organization that accredits college and university programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology.

ABET accreditation is recognized as a standard of quality for these programs, ensuring that they meet the needs of their professions and provide a rigorous education that prepares graduates to enter the workforce.

The Bachelor of Science and Honors Bachelor of Science degree programs in the Computer Science Computer Systems Option are accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET.

## Student Outcomes (SOs)

Graduates of the program will have an ability to:[^1]

1. Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
2. Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
4. Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
5. Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline.
6. Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.

<!-- ## Performance Indicators (PIs)

Performance indicators are measurable statements that describe what evidence of student achievement looks like for each outcome.

Each SO has three performance indicators that are relevant for the Capstone series.

### SO1

1. Students can accurately identify and describe the underlying principles and constraints relevant to a complex computing problem.
2. Students can develop and articulate multiple solution strategies and evaluate each based on identified criteria and constraints.
3. Students demonstrate the ability to integrate cross-disciplinary knowledge into their problem-solving process.

### SO2

1. Students can create a design document that outlines the system architecture, components, and interfaces that meet the specified requirements.
2. Students successfully implement a solution that functions according to the design specifications.
3. Students conduct a thorough evaluation of the solution, including testing and validation, to demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency against the requirements.

### SO3

1. Students can produce clear, structured, and detailed documentation of their project, including a user manual and developer guidelines.
2. Students deliver professional presentations that clearly communicate project objectives, processes, outcomes, and relevance to both technical and non-technical audiences.
3. Students can effectively participate in project meetings, articulate their ideas and respond constructively to peer feedback.

### SO4

1. Students identify and discuss relevant ethical and legal issues in their project work.
2. Students incorporate ethical considerations into project decision-making processes.
3. Students can propose and justify resolutions when faced with ethical dilemmas in case studies or real project scenarios.

### SO5

1. Students demonstrate the ability to fulfill assigned roles and responsibilities within a team setting.
2. Students contribute positively to team discussions and decision-making processes.
3. Students can lead a segment or phase of a project, managing resources and coordinating efforts effectively.

### SO6

1. Students can articulate how specific computer science theories apply to the design and development of their project.
2. Students demonstrate proficiency in applying software development best practices and standards in their projects.
3. Students' projects show an innovative application of computing principles to solve practical problems. -->
