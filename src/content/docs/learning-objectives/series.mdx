Senior Software Engineering Project I, II, and III, collectively referred to as the Capstone series, are designed to equip future graduates with the skills and experiences necessary to meet the challenges of professional life. Throughout this three-course sequence, Capstone students will collaborate in teams on a comprehensive project that spans three terms.

Capstone | Class Name | Credits
---------|------------|--------
CS 461   | Senior Software Engineering Project I   | 3
CS 462   | Senior Software Engineering Project II  | 3
CS 463   | Senior Software Engineering Project III | 2

Each project within the Capstone series serves as an opportunity for students to enhance their professional portfolios, acquire new skills, and develop into more proficient engineers. This hands-on experience not only deepens technical expertise but also prepares students to effectively tackle real-world engineering problems.

You will be judged on the following facets:

- Reflection
- Requirements and Specifications
- Design, Implementation, and Deployment
- Verification and Validation
- Teamwork
- Communication

Lectures mostly cover expectations and project management fundamentals. We will also host mandatory category-specific lectures.

## CS 461

In 461, you will be assigned a project (or start working on your own, if it was approved) together with some of your peers.  This first course in the series focuses mainly on the requirements and specifications. You have to complete a first-iteration prototype. 

## CS 462

In this second course of the Capstone series, more emphasis is set on the design, implementation and deployment, while still refining the requirements and specifications. You will maintain project control processes and deliver a series of iterations on your previous prototype.

## CS 463

Finally, in CS 463, you will finish the design, implementation and deployment, and tackle the verification and validation full-on. This is the final release of your project in the context of this course series. You will discuss the social, legal, and economic implications of the project. You will present your project, technically (to your peers) and to the public (Engineering Expo or alternatives).
