Senior Software Engineering Project I, II, and III, collectively referred to as the Capstone series, are designed to equip future graduates with the skills and experiences necessary to meet the challenges of professional life. Throughout this three-course sequence, Capstone students will collaborate in teams on a comprehensive project that spans three terms.

Capstone | Class Name | Credits
---------|------------|--------
CS 461   | Senior Software Engineering Project I   | 3
CS 462   | Senior Software Engineering Project II  | 3
CS 463   | Senior Software Engineering Project III | 2

Each project within the Capstone series serves as an opportunity for students to enhance their professional portfolios, acquire new skills, and develop into more proficient engineers. This hands-on experience not only deepens technical expertise but also prepares students to effectively tackle real-world engineering problems.

Students will be judged by their project partner or mentor (25%), peers (25%), and instructors (50%). We look at the following facets:

- Reflection
- Requirements and Specifications
- Design, Implementation, and Deployment
- Verification and Validation
- Teamwork
- Communication

While project partners and mentors will evaluate students on all facets, the emphasis on each facet will change throughout the series to reflect the project's progression.

## CS 461

In 461, students will be assigned a project (or start working on their own, if it was approved) together with some of their peers.  This first course in the series focuses mainly on the requirements and specifications. Students have to complete an initial prototype. 

## CS 462

In this second course of the Capstone series, more emphasis is set on the design, implementation and deployment, while still refining the requirements and specifications. Students will maintain project control processes and deliver a series of iterations on their previous prototype.

## CS 463

Finally, in CS 463, students will finish the design, implementation and deployment, and tackle the verification and validation full-on. This is the final release of their project in the context of this course series.
