CS 461 and 462 are Writing Intensive Courses (WIC). We don't want to make you write for the sake of writing, so we align the WIC learning outcomes with the ABET ones. All the writing will happen through traditional software engineering activities, such as writing requirements, documentation, or outreach material (among other things).

## Learning Outcomes

Graduates of the program will have an ability to:

1. Develop and articulate content knowledge and critical thinking in the discipline through frequent practice of informal and formal writing
2. Demonstrate knowledge/understanding of audience expectations, genres, and conventions appropriate to communicating in the discipline
3. Demonstrate the ability to compose a document of at least 2000 words through multiple aspects of writing, including brainstorming, drafting, using sources appropriately, and revising comprehensively after receiving feedback on a draft

## Understanding WIC Writing Expectations

Writing in WIC courses is more than just meeting a word count: it's about practicing the kinds of communication you'll use as a professional. This section explains the types of writing you'll do, what's expected, and how each activity supports your growth as a communicator in computer science.

### Formal vs. Informal Writing

In WIC courses, you will do both **informal** and **formal** writing:

- **Informal writing** (low-stakes, frequent)  
  - Purpose: practice, reflection, brainstorming, documenting thought process  
  - Examples: design journals, progress reflections, quick write-ups of debugging or team discussions  
  - Grading: checked mostly for completion and effort, not polish  

- **Formal writing** (high-stakes, polished)  
  - Purpose: professional communication, documentation, and audience-focused writing  
  - Examples: project proposals, requirement specs, design docs, technical reports, user guides  
  - Grading: evaluated on clarity, structure, correctness, and professional standards  

Informal writing helps you **develop and test ideas**; formal writing demonstrates your ability to **communicate them professionally**.

### Content Knowledge & Critical Thinking

- Goes beyond “reporting facts” — you should analyze trade-offs, justify design decisions, and reflect on outcomes.  
- Informal writing is where you **practice this reasoning**; formal writing is where you **demonstrate it clearly and persuasively**.  

### Audience, Genres, and Conventions

- Writing looks different depending on the audience.  
- Example: a **design spec** uses precise technical language and diagrams, while a **user manual** avoids jargon and emphasizes clarity and step-by-step instructions.  
- Expect to adapt your tone and structure based on whether you are writing for teammates, instructors, stakeholders, or end-users.  

### Major Document & Writing Process

- You will complete at least one substantial document (2000+ words).  
- This is not just about word count — it's about following a **professional writing process**:  
  1. Brainstorm and plan  
  2. Draft and integrate sources appropriately  
  3. Receive and apply feedback  
  4. Revise comprehensively into a polished product  
- The goal is to mirror real-world software engineering documentation cycles.  

## What This Means for You

- You'll **write often**, but most writing will be short and low-stakes: practice that prepares you for the bigger assignments.  
- You'll learn to **adapt your writing to different audiences**, from teammates to end-users.  
- You'll complete at least one **major polished document (2000+ words)**, developed through drafting, feedback, and revision.  
- Success in WIC is about building a **professional communication skillset**, not just “checking off a word count.”
