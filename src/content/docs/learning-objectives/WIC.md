CS 461 and 462 are Writing Intensive Courses (WIC). We don't want to make you write for the sake of writing, so we align the WIC learning outcomes with the ABET ones. All the writing will happen through traditional software engineering activites, such as writing requirements, documentation, or outreach material (among other things).

## Learning Outcomes

1. Develop and articulate content knowledge and critical thinking in the discipline through frequent practice of informal and formal writing
2. Demonstrate knowledge/understanding of audience expectations, genres, and conventions appropriate to communicating in the discipline
3. Demonstrate the ability to compose a document of at least 2000 words through multiple aspects of writing, including brainstorming, drafting, using sources appropriately, and revising comprehensively after receiving feedback on a draft
