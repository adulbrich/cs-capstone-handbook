The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is a nonprofit organization that accredits college and university programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology.

ABET accreditation is recognized as a standard of quality for these programs, ensuring that they meet the needs of their professions and provide a rigorous education that prepares graduates to enter the workforce.

The Bachelor of Science and Honors Bachelor of Science degree programs in the Computer Science Computer Systems Option are accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET.

## Student Outcomes (SOs)

Graduates of the program will have an ability to:[^1]

1. Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
2. Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program's discipline.
3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
4. Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
5. Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program's discipline.
6. Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.
