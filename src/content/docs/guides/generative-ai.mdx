Most of the recommendations below are supported by most code editors and AI agents. Check your tool's documentation for specifics.

Tooling is evolving rapidly. New features and capabilities are being added frequently. Stay updated with the latest developments in AI-assisted coding tools to leverage new functionalities as they become available.

Some zero-config tools do exist. For example, for web projects, consider [Ultracite](https://www.ultracite.ai/).

## Instructions

Setup custom instructions or prompts for your AI code editor. 

These instructions will guide the AI in generating code that fits your project's needs and style. 

When providing instructions, consider including:

- Project Overview: A brief description of your project, its goals, and its target audience.
- Technology Stack: Specify the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries you are using.
- Coding Standards: Outline any specific coding conventions or best practices you want the AI to follow.
- Constraints: Mention any limitations or constraints, such as performance requirements or compatibility issues.
- Testing Requirements: Specify if you want the AI to generate tests along with the code.
- Documentation: Indicate if you want the AI to include comments or documentation in the generated code.
- Collaboration Style: Describe how you want the AI to interact with you (e.g., ask questions, provide explanations, etc.).
- Persona: Define a persona for the AI to adopt, such as a senior developer, a code reviewer, or a mentor.

## Memory

Setup memory for your AI code editor. 

Memory allows the AI to retain context over time, making interactions more coherent and relevant to your project's history and goals. Ask your AI code editor or agent to remember important details about your project, preferences, or specific requirements in a separate reference file. 

## MCP Servers

Setup MCP servers to empower your AI code editors. 

Some examples:

- [context7](https://context7.com/) provides up-to-date documentation to your agent
- [Tavily](https://www.tavily.com/) allows your agent to browse the web

Many other options exist. Explore and choose the ones that best fit your needs. Tell your models how and when to use them.

## Choosing the Right Model

Things change rapidly in the AI world. New models are released frequently, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. 

Consider looking at the latest benchmarks and comparisons to choose the right model for your needs.

Some resources to get you started:

- [AI Benchmarking Hub](https://epoch.ai/benchmarks)
- [LiveBench](https://livebench.ai/)
- [Benchable](https://benchable.ai/models)

Here are some relevant metrics to consider:

- [Context window](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows)
- Speed
- Cost
- Ability
- Accuracy

As students, you can access [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education) for free. It includes access to Copilot Pro and other perks.
