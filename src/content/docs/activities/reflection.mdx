{/* Consider reflecting on past projects as well, but for that we need a mechanism to index past projects in a format that can be reviewed by students. */}

## Read ACM Queue Articles

## Project Retrospective

A comprehensive project retrospective should cover multiple aspects of the project lifecycle, providing a detailed analysis of what went well, what didn't, and how future projects can be improved.

The project retrospective is a key summative assessment of your CS Capstone course, and is happening at the end of CS 463. We explain below what should be included in the document. You can adapt the contents based on your project category.

We will use your project retrospective as reflection activities for our future CS Capstone students.
