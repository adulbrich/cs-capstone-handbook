<Badge text="Individual Activity" variant="success" class="mb-6"/>

If your software includes text, videos, images for users, you might want to consider revising them according to accessibility and English as a Second Language (ESL) guidelines. 

To start, here's an excellent interactive article about [what makes writing more readable](https://pudding.cool/2022/02/plain).

- Resources at the federal level include [plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) and [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/).
- Oregon State University also has an article on [Language and Disability](https://accessibility.oregonstate.edu/language-and-disability).
- Another good resource is the [Simplified Technical English (STE) international standard](https://asd-ste100.org/), great for an ESL audience.

There are different ways to test the readability score of your text or accessibility of your content. Here are some examples:

- [WebFX Readability Test](https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/)
- [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/)
- [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)

Decide on an approach to improve your content's accessibility depending on your audience, write a brief summary of what you learned and how you plan to adapt your content. Sharing your revised content or text is a plus.
