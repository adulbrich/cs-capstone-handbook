All teamwork activities must be attended by **all** team members. If it's not the case, valid justification must be provided from both the team and the student who did not attend. Regularly missing team events or meetings will not look good on your final grade.

## Identify Individual Learning Objectives and Skills

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

Each team member creates two lists: 

- one for motivations and learning objectives, and 
- another for current strengths and skills. 

While teams often focus on existing strengths during formation, you'll benefit more by prioritizing learning objectives and motivations, as there's ample time to develop new skills throughout the project. 

Learning goals can extend beyond technical skills to include societal or entrepreneurial interests. Once everyone has their lists, explore ways to complement each other's strengths and objectives. For instance, one person may teach a skill they excel in to someone who wants to learn it.

Submit a summary of the discussion. Include the list of learning objectives, skills, and action items.

## Regular Stand-Up Meetings 

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

Stand-up meetings help keep the team aligned by discussing daily progress, identifying challenges, and setting short-term goals. These meetings ensure transparency and collective problem-solving.

Hold daily stand-up meetings where each team member shares what they completed, what they're working on, and any blockers they face. Meetings should be brief (10-15 minutes) and focus on keeping the team updated.

Alternatively you can do it only a few times per week, or asynchronously on your preferred instant messaging platform. 

:::note
For this activity to be valid, stand-up meetings must happen at least once a week.
:::

Submit a summary report of key discussion points from the stand-ups since the beginning of the term. Highlight important decisions made, challenges raised, and how they were addressed.

## Sprint Retrospectives 

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

Retrospectives give the team a chance to reflect on the completed sprint, identifying what worked well and what did not, and proposing actionable improvements for the next sprint.

:::note
For this activity to be valid, you must have defined the number of sprints (more than two) at the beginning of the term, and done a proper retrospective at the end of each sprint.
:::

Conduct a retrospective at the end of each sprint. Discuss successes, challenges, and potential improvements. Focus on actionable steps to refine the team's workflow and collaboration. You can read about the [term retrospective assignments](/project-evaluation/assignments/#fall-and-winter-retrospectives) to learn more.

Provide a summary of all retrospectives done during the term that outlines what the team did well, areas for improvement, and specific actions the team will take moving forward. For each action, reflect on their effectiveness.

## Progress Reports or Sprint Reviews

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

Regular progress reports or sprint reviews allow the team to assess how well they are meeting project milestones. These reviews keep both the team and stakeholders informed and aligned.

:::note
For this activity to be valid, you must have defined the number of sprints (more than two) at the beginning of the term, and done a proper review at the end of each sprint, or meet at least biweekly for updates.
:::

At the end of each sprint or week, prepare a sprint review or progress report. This should include a review of completed tasks, what is still pending, and any adjustments to the project's trajectory. Include feedback from stakeholders.

Submit all the reports since the beginning of the term, summarizing the completed tasks, any deviations from the plan, upcoming tasks, and feedback from stakeholders.

## Team Formation Strategies Assessment

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

Assessing team formation strategies helps ensure that the team is structured in a way that optimizes collaboration and leverages each member's strengths, leading to better performance.

Identify which stage of formation your team is in, and apply appropriate strategies to move your team forward.

The most common model is probably [Tuckman's stages of group development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman's_stages_of_group_development).

| Stage | Characteristics | Strategies |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Forming | Team members are polite, roles are unclear, high dependence on leader for direction | Clarify goals, set expectations, encourage open communication |
| Storming | Conflicts arise, clashing ideas, team members challenge each other | Address conflicts openly, promote active listening, foster trust and collaboration |
| Norming | Team begins to resolve differences, stronger cohesion, more cooperation | Encourage collaboration, reinforce team norms, facilitate role clarity and feedback |
| Performing | Team operates efficiently, strong autonomy, high motivation, and productivity | Support autonomy, celebrate successes, continue providing feedback, and adapt as needed |
| Adjourning | Team disbands after completing goals, members experience mixed emotions | Celebrate achievements, conduct reflection sessions, provide closure and next steps |

## Team Dysfunctions Assessment

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team model helps teams identify and address key barriers to effective teamwork. By understanding these dysfunctions -- lack of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results -- teams can proactively develop strategies to improve collaboration, accountability, and results. It promotes open communication, mutual trust, and a focus on shared goals, which are essential for team success.

Here's a table outlining the five dysfunctions of a team from [Patrick Lencioni's model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5EQW026alY), with their characteristics and strategies:

| Level | Dysfunction | Characteristics | Strategies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1         | **Absence of Trust**               | Team members are unwilling to be vulnerable or admit weaknesses.                                     | Build trust through vulnerability, encourage open communication, and team-building activities.    |
| 2         | **Fear of Conflict**               | Team avoids discussions or disagreements, leading to unresolved issues.                              | Foster a culture of healthy debate, encourage open dialogue, and address conflicts directly.      |
| 3         | **Lack of Commitment**             | Team members are unclear about decisions or hesitant to fully commit.                                | Ensure clarity in decisions, create shared goals, and make commitments visible.                   |
| 4         | **Avoidance of Accountability**    | Team members hesitate to hold each other accountable for their responsibilities.                     | Set clear expectations, create accountability structures, and encourage peer-to-peer feedback.    |
| 5         | **Inattention to Results**         | Focus shifts from collective success to individual goals or status.                                  | Focus on collective outcomes, track measurable results, and celebrate team achievements.          |

Here's a [shorter video of the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCxct4CR-To).

Submit a report identifying the dysfunctions within the team, proposed strategies for addressing each dysfunction, and a reflection on how these will improve team performance.
