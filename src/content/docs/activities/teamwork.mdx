All teamwork activities must be attended by **all** team members. If it's not the case, valid justification must be provided from both the team and the student who did not attend. Regularly missing team events or meetings will not look good on your final grade.

## Identify Individual Learning Objectives and Skills

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

Each team member creates two lists: 

- one for motivations and learning objectives, and 
- another for current strengths and skills. 

While teams often focus on existing strengths during formation, you'll benefit more by prioritizing learning objectives and motivations, as there's ample time to develop new skills throughout the project. 

Learning goals can extend beyond technical skills to include societal or entrepreneurial interests. Once everyone has their lists, explore ways to complement each other's strengths and objectives. For instance, one person may teach a skill they excel in to someone who wants to learn it.

Submit a summary of the discussion. Include the list of learning objectives, skills, and action items.

## Regular Stand-Up Meetings 

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

Stand-up meetings help keep the team aligned by discussing daily progress, identifying challenges, and setting short-term goals. These meetings ensure transparency and collective problem-solving.

Hold daily stand-up meetings where each team member shares what they completed, what they're working on, and any blockers they face. Meetings should be brief (10-15 minutes) and focus on keeping the team updated.

Alternatively you can do it only a few times per week, or asynchronously on your preferred instant messaging platform. 

:::note
For this activity to be valid, stand-up meetings must happen at least once a week.
:::

Submit a summary report of key discussion points from the stand-ups since the beginning of the term. Highlight important decisions made, challenges raised, and how they were addressed.

## Sprint Retrospectives 

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

Retrospectives give the team a chance to reflect on the completed sprint, identifying what worked well and what did not, and proposing actionable improvements for the next sprint.

:::note
For this activity to be valid, you must have defined the number of sprints (more than two) at the beginning of the term, and done a proper retrospective at the end of each sprint.
:::

Conduct a retrospective at the end of each sprint. Discuss successes, challenges, and potential improvements. Focus on actionable steps to refine the team's workflow and collaboration. You can read about the [term retrospective assignments](/project-evaluation/assignments/#fall-and-winter-retrospectives) to learn more.

Provide a summary of all retrospectives done during the term that outlines what the team did well, areas for improvement, and specific actions the team will take moving forward. For each action, reflect on their effectiveness.

## Progress Reports or Sprint Reviews

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

Regular progress reports or sprint reviews allow the team to assess how well they are meeting project milestones. These reviews keep both the team and stakeholders informed and aligned.

:::note
For this activity to be valid, you must have defined the number of sprints (more than two) at the beginning of the term, and done a proper review at the end of each sprint, or meet at least biweekly for updates.
:::

At the end of each sprint or week, prepare a sprint review or progress report. This should include a review of completed tasks, what is still pending, and any adjustments to the project's trajectory. Include feedback from stakeholders.

Submit all the reports since the beginning of the term, summarizing the completed tasks, any deviations from the plan, upcoming tasks, and feedback from stakeholders.

## Team Formation Strategies Assessment

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

Assessing team formation strategies helps ensure that the team is structured in a way that optimizes collaboration and leverages each member's strengths, leading to better performance.

Identify which stage of formation your team is in, and apply appropriate strategies to move your team forward.

The most common model is probably [Tuckman's stages of group development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman's_stages_of_group_development).

| Stage | Characteristics | Strategies |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Forming | Team members are polite, roles are unclear, high dependence on leader for direction | Clarify goals, set expectations, encourage open communication |
| Storming | Conflicts arise, clashing ideas, team members challenge each other | Address conflicts openly, promote active listening, foster trust and collaboration |
| Norming | Team begins to resolve differences, stronger cohesion, more cooperation | Encourage collaboration, reinforce team norms, facilitate role clarity and feedback |
| Performing | Team operates efficiently, strong autonomy, high motivation, and productivity | Support autonomy, celebrate successes, continue providing feedback, and adapt as needed |
| Adjourning | Team disbands after completing goals, members experience mixed emotions | Celebrate achievements, conduct reflection sessions, provide closure and next steps |

## Team Dysfunctions Assessment

<Badge text="Team Activity" variant="note" class="mb-6" />

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team model helps teams identify and address key barriers to effective teamwork. By understanding these dysfunctions -- lack of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results -- teams can proactively develop strategies to improve collaboration, accountability, and results. It promotes open communication, mutual trust, and a focus on shared goals, which are essential for team success.

Here's a table outlining the five dysfunctions of a team from [Patrick Lencioni's model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5EQW026alY), with their characteristics and strategies:

| Level | Dysfunction | Characteristics | Strategies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1         | **Absence of Trust**               | Team members are unwilling to be vulnerable or admit weaknesses.                                     | Build trust through vulnerability, encourage open communication, and team-building activities.    |
| 2         | **Fear of Conflict**               | Team avoids discussions or disagreements, leading to unresolved issues.                              | Foster a culture of healthy debate, encourage open dialogue, and address conflicts directly.      |
| 3         | **Lack of Commitment**             | Team members are unclear about decisions or hesitant to fully commit.                                | Ensure clarity in decisions, create shared goals, and make commitments visible.                   |
| 4         | **Avoidance of Accountability**    | Team members hesitate to hold each other accountable for their responsibilities.                     | Set clear expectations, create accountability structures, and encourage peer-to-peer feedback.    |
| 5         | **Inattention to Results**         | Focus shifts from collective success to individual goals or status.                                  | Focus on collective outcomes, track measurable results, and celebrate team achievements.          |

Here's a [shorter video of the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCxct4CR-To).

Submit a report identifying the dysfunctions within the team, proposed strategies for addressing each dysfunction, and a reflection on how these will improve team performance.

### Google's Five Dynamics

Google has identified [five key dynamics](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-emea/future-of-marketing/management-and-culture/five-dynamics-effective-team/) that distinguish effective teams:

1. Psychological Safety: team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable without fear of embarrassment or punishment.
2. Dependability: members reliably complete quality work on time, ensuring trust and accountability within the team.
3. Structure and Clarity: clear roles, plans, and goals are established, providing direction and understanding of expectations.
4. Meaning: work is personally significant to team members, fostering motivation and engagement.
5. Impact: team members perceive their work as making a difference and contributing to the organization's goals.

These dynamics emphasize the importance of interpersonal relationships and a supportive environment in achieving team effectiveness. Psychological safety is what matters most. 

Self-assess (green/yellow/red) your team on these five dynamics. You can use [Google's Discussion Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lgiz6mwZeyWEaJxN_NMI-tI5Qijv2BHh27DPLeSLE40/edit).

### Team Barometer

Jimmy Janlén outlines how to use the [team barometer to assess if the team is getting better over time](https://blog.crisp.se/2014/01/30/jimmyjanlen/team-barometer-self-evaluation-tool). Self-assess (green/yellow/red) your team on these cards. Feel free to opt for alternatives such as fewer cards or the perfection game (see original article).

| Card | Green | Red |
| ---- | ----- | --- |
| Trust | We have the courage to be honest with each other. We don't hesitate to engage in constructive conflicts. | Members rarely speak their mind. We avoid conflicts. Discussions are tentative and polite. |
| Collaboration | The team cross-pollinates, sharing perspectives, context and innovations with other teams, and other parts of the organization. | Work is done individually. Little or no collaboration within the team or with other teams. |
| Feedback | We give positive feedback, but also call out one another's deficiencies and unproductive behaviors. | We rarely praise each other or give feedback or criticize each other for acting irresponsibly or breaking our Working Agreement. |
| Meeting Engagement | People are engaged in meetings. They want to be there. Discussions are passionate. | Many feel like prisoners in the meeting. Only a few participate in discussions.              |
| Commitment | We commit to our plans and hold each other accountable for doing our best to reach our goals and execute assigned action points. | We don't have real consensus about our goals. We don't really buy in to the plan or follow up that people keep their commitments. |
| Improving | We passionately strive to figure out how to work better and more efficiently as a team. We try to “know” if we get better. | We don't focus on questioning our process or way of working. If someone asked us to prove that we've gotten better we have no clue how we would demonstrate that. |
| Mutually Responsible| We feel mutually responsible for achieving our goals. We win and fail as a team. | When we fail we try to figure out who did what wrong. When we succeed we celebrate individuals. If we pay attention to it at all… |
| Power | We go out of our way to unblock ourselves when we run into impediments or dependencies. | When we run into problems or dependencies we alert managers, ask for their help, and then wait. |
| Pride | We feel pride in our work and what we accomplish. | We feel ashamed of our pace and the quality of our results. |
| Relationships | Team members spend time and effort building strong relationships among themselves, as well as with partners outside the team. | We don't really know each other or what makes others “tick”. |
| Ownership | We engage in defining our own goals and take ownership of our destiny. | We act as pawns in a game of chess. We don't demand involvement in defining our goals and destiny. |
| Sharing | We share what we know and learn. No one withholds information that affects the team. | People do stuff under the radar and often forget to share news or relevant information. |
| Boosts each other | We unleash each other's passion and care for each other's personal development. We leverage our differences. | We don't know in which areas people want to grow. We have trouble collaborating since we are very different and view things differently. |
| Loyalty | No one has hidden agendas. We feel that everyone's loyalty is with THIS team. | The team feels like a diverse group of people with different goals and loyalties that lie elsewhere. |
| Passion | Each member wants THIS team to be great and successful. | People just come to work for 8 hours and focus on their own tasks. |
| Integrity | We honor our processes and working agreements even when we are put under pressure. | Our behaviors, collaboration, and communication fall apart when we get stressed. |

### Spotify's Squad Health Check

Spotify started running Agile [squad health checks](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/09/squad-health-check-model/) around 2014. They since have [reflected on their experience](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/03/getting-more-from-your-team-health-checks/). Self-assess (green/yellow/red) your team in these areas.

| Area | Example of Awesome (green) | Example of Crappy (red) |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Easy to release | Releasing is simple, safe, painless & mostly automated.	| Releasing is risky, painful, lots of manual work, and takes forever. |
|Suitable process | Our way of working fits us perfectly | Our way of working sucks |
| Tech quality (code base health) | We're proud of the quality of our code! It is clean, easy to read, and has great test coverage. | Our code is a pile of dung, and technical debt is raging out of control |
| Value | We deliver great stuff! We're proud of it and our stakeholders are really happy. | We deliver crap. We feel ashamed to deliver it. Our stakeholders hate us. |
| Speed | We get stuff done really quickly.No waiting, no delays. | We never seem to get done with anything. We keep getting stuck or interrupted. Stories keep getting stuck on dependencies |
| Mission | We know exactly why we are here, and we are really excited about it | We have no idea why we are here, there is no high level picture or focus. Our so-called mission is completely unclear and uninspiring. |
| Fun | We love going to work, and have great fun working together | Boooooooring. |
| Learning | We're learning lots of interesting stuff all the time! | We never have time to learn anything |
| Support | We always get great support & help when we ask for it! | We keep getting stuck because we can't get the support & help that we ask for. |
| Pawns or players | We are in control of our destiny! We decide what to build and how to build it. | We are just pawns in a game of chess, with no influence over what we build or how we build it |
