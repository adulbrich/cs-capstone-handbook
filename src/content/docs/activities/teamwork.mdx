:::note
The team charter is a key summative assessment of your CS Capstone course, and is happening at the end of CS 461. 

This document should be reviewed regularly. A final project retrospective will happen at the end of CS 463.
:::

The team charter is a must for high performing teams. It sets clear expectations and guidelines for how your team members will collaborate and operate throughout the project. 

The charter will develop a sense of shared responsibility, increase one own awareness, empower the team to lead according to agreements, and enhance the quality of the team process.

The agreements in the charter will work well when:

- they are important to you, 
- they are limited in number, 
- they are fully supported by everyone, 
- the team is reminded of agreements during process checks,
- the team is reminded of agreements when they are broken.

You would be surprised how many times that last one does not happen.

The team charter should be reviewed every term, or after retrospectives, whatever comes first. Make sure to document updates to your charter (for example by versioning it, or exporting new versions to PDF, or adding a change log at the beginning of the document).

We list below what should be included.
