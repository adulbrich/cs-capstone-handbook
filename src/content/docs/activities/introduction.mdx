During the course of the year, you will be judged on different facets, either through **formative** or **summative** assessments. These will demonstrate your mastery of the course learning objectives.

Formative assessment will help you achieve intended learning outcomes and prepare for summative assessments.

This section lists different activities that you can do with your team or individually. They are intended for formative assessment purposes, and you can pick the ones that are relevant to your project. Feel free to email your instruction team to receive early feedback.

Typical summative assignments are project presentations and demonstrations, project documentation and reflection. For each of these assignments, you'll have to complete a choice of activities. For more information, check the [summative assignments](/project-evaluation/assignments/) or refer to the assignments in Canvas.
