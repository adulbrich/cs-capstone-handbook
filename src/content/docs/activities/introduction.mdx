During the course of the year, you will be judged on different facets. These will demonstrate your mastery of the course learning objectives.

This section lists different activities that you can do with your team or individually. They are intended to help you achieve intended learning outcomes, prepare for project evaluations, but more importantly **to deliver a high quality project**. 

**You are encouraged to email your instruction team to receive early feedback on your progress.**

:::note
If you or your project partner have other ideas of what could be good activities for your project, [ping the instructors](mailto:cs-46x-help@oregonstate.edu) with the proposed activity name and description.

Typical assignments are project presentations, demonstrations, project documentation, and retrospectives. For each of these assignments, you *may* need to complete a choice of activities. For more information, check the [assignments](/project-evaluation/assignments/) or refer to the assignments in Canvas.

### The YC Startup School Curriculum

[Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/) is a free online course on how to start a startup, by the world's top startup accelerator: Y Combinator.

It did not fit in any specific category because it touches on many different aspects of building a product and creating a company, so we've decided to list it here!

This activity is useful both as a career skill-building tool and as a way to succeed with your New Product or Game project!

If you are interested in commercializing your project, consider joining a startup accelerator program. [OSU has one](https://advantage.oregonstate.edu/advantage-accelerator). Other famous ones include [Station F](https://stationf.co/) in Paris (France) and [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) in the San Francisco Bay Area.
