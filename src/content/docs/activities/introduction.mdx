During the course of the year, you will be judged on different facets, either through **formative** or **summative** assessments. These will demonstrate your mastery of the course learning objectives.

Formative assessment will help you achieve intended learning outcomes and prepare for summative assessments. The feedback is mostly qualitative in nature. 

This section lists different activities that you can do with your team or individually. Most of them are intended for formative assessment purposes, and you can pick the ones that are relevant to your project.

For this CS Capstone series, typical summative assignments are project presentations and demonstrations. Refer to the assignments on Canvas for more information.
