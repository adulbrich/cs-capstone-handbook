In classifying capstone projects, there are various perspectives one could adopt. In this handbook, and throughout our discussions, we'll primarily categorize projects based on the outcomes they aim to achieve. Presently, we recognize five main categories:

[How will these categories be graded?](../../project-evaluation/outcomes)

## FOSS

This category involves contributing patches to an existing Free/Open-Source Software project. Examples include writing patches for the Rust compiler, the Xen hypervisor, the Habitica todo-list game, or the OSU Open Source Lab repositories.

Established FOSS projects typically have a list of features they need help implementing, thus defining the opportunities.

## Research

Collaborate with a professor on a research topic, aiming to publish a small paper with your findings. This type of project is ideal for those considering graduate school. It's worth noting that you can fulfill the teamwork component of the capstone outside of class through significant interactions with the professor's research group.

Professors are often aware of potential research opportunities. Remember, an opportunity is something that someone else cares about. In this case, the professor will have insights into what the research community might find valuable.

## Consultant

Develop software for a specific external project partner. Examples include creating a citizen-science hive-tracking app for a non-profit or collaborating with a professor from the School of Psychological Science at Oregon State University.

## New Product

This category involves creating a new product, which may or may not become a viable business.

Here, you define the opportunity. While exciting, this also entails some degree of uncertainty and requires *significant* effort.

## Advanced Technology

Undertake a project that leverages your technical skills, often combining knowledge and skills from multiple advanced technical elective courses. Examples include building a distributed storage system, developing a data auditing/cleaning system, or creating a graphics tool that simplifies sprite generation for video games.

Projects in this category focus heavily on technical challenges, with the opportunity lying in the interest other engineers have in learning about them.
