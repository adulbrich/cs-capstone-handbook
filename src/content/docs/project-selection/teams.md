There are different ways to form a Capstone project team, including:

## Friends

Team up with friends. While familiarity can be an asset, productivity may sometimes be challenging to maintain.

## Shared Interests

Form a team with classmates who share your interests. Though initial effort is required to establish connections, this approach can yield high productivity and rewards.

## External Collaborations

Teaming up with individuals outside your cohort is possible, though less common. This includes:

### Multidisciplinary Projects

Collaborating with students from other engineering programs.

> This constitutes a separate Capstone section (non-CS).

### Electrical and Computer Engineering Projects

Options include:

1. Collaborating with an ECE Capstone team on a shared project, within a CS Capstone team.
2. Joining an ECE Capstone team for their project.

> Option 2 constitues a separate Capstone section (non-CS).

### Research Groups

Collaborating with graduate students or professors as part of a research project.
