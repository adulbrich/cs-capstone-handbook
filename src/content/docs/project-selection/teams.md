There are different ways to form a Capstone project team (see below).

We require each team to have at least one experienced "external partner".

Some categories have a project partner by definition (Research, Consultant), but they might not be technical enough. In that case, consider getting a faculty or industry mentor that has the technical acumen to guide you.

If your project does not have a partner at all (New Product or Game, FOSS, Advanced Technology), it is mandatory to find one or more mentors as well. This will increase your chances of success. Mentors can be faculty, industry professionals, or other people that can contribute positively to the success of your project.

## Friends

Team up with friends. While familiarity can be an asset, productivity may sometimes be challenging to maintain.

## Shared Interests

Form a team with classmates who share your interests. Though initial effort is required to establish connections, this approach can yield high productivity and rewards.

## External Collaborations

Teaming up with individuals outside your cohort is possible, though less common. This includes:

### Multidisciplinary Engineering Projects

Collaborating with students from other engineering programs. Teams might be larger. Communication will play an even bigger role; different engineering majors might not "speak the same language".

> This constitutes a separate Capstone section (non-CS).

### Electrical and Computer Engineering Projects

Options include:

1. Collaborating with an ECE Capstone team on a shared project, within a CS Capstone team.
2. Joining an ECE Capstone team for their project.

> Option 2 constitutes a separate Capstone section (non-CS).

### Research Groups

Collaborating with graduate students or professors as part of a research project.

### Miscellaneous

You are generally encouraged to collaborate with external parties. Examples include: students or faculty from other colleges, professional organizations, knowledgeable staff from your partner organization (if applicable), online communities, etc.
