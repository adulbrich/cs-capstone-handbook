Your instruction team starts recruiting projects during the previous academic year with a peak in the summer months. We reach out to previous project partners, industries, organizations, faculty, and students.

:::note
If, as a student, you have your own project idea (can be of any categories but you need a project partner or mentor), you can [submit the project](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/pages/) for review before end of August. If accepted, you'll be able to work on that project with some of your peers.
:::

The list of approved projects for the year will be made available around mid-September. You'll receive a survey in the first week of class to choose your top choices. If your own project was approved, you'll be automatically assigned to it. 

You can specify team member preferences as well (see [team formation](/project-selection/teams/)).

By the end of week 1, the instruction team will assign every student to a project and team. As soon as these appear in Canvas, you should start talking to your new team and get organized.

:::note
Make a note of which category your project belongs to, as it will impact how the outcome will be evaluated.
:::

Once you talk to your team, the first step is **to reach out to and meet your project partner or mentor**. Through them, get clarifications on the project, expectations, deliverables, and start figuring out the timeline. Make them aware of the main assignments this term as well as the grading rubrics. All the information is available in the handbook. The handbook is subject to small changes; always refer to Canvas for current assignments.
