The Capstone Series has some funds and resources available to support student projects. Software, hardware, user research, marketing, and AWS resources are all subject to approval by the instruction team (see Canvas for the request form). The HPC and iLabs are available to all engineering students and faculty.

## Software, Hardware, User Research, and Marketing

The Capstone instruction team has a small budget to cover project-related expenses such as hardware purchases, software licenses, user research, or light marketing. We also have some hardware inventory from previous years. All of the expenses are subject to approval.

## Amazon Cloud Services (AWS)

The Capstone instruction team has a couple AWS accounts available. Upon approval, students can either receive access to one of these account for the duration of the academic year, or get some services running (e.g., Helix Core Version Control). These accounts have budget limits and are nuked at the end of the year. Access is subject to approval.

## Microsoft Azure 

For applications developed for certain OSU departments, students might be able to deploy them on OSU's Azure infrastructure. This is not in the hands of the Capstone instruction team.

## High-Performance Computer (HPC)

As students, engineering students have standard access to OSU's [High Performance Computer (HPC)](https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/hpc). To gain access, you'll have to follow a mandatory training session. This is not in the hands of the Capstone instruction team.

## Innovation Labs (iLabs)

Similarly to the HPC, engineering students have access to OSU's [Innovation Labs (iLabs)](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/tools-services/iLabs). To gain access to iLabs spaces, you must complete a series of qualifications to ensure proper training. This is not in the hands of the Capstone instruction team.
