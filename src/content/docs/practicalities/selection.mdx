Your instruction team starts recruiting projects during the previous academic year with a peak in the summer months. We reach out to previous project partners, industries, organizations, faculty, and students.

:::note
If, as a student, you have your own project idea (can be of any categories but you need a project partner or mentor), you can [submit the project](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/pages/) for review before early September. If accepted, you'll be able to work on that project with some of your peers.
:::

The list of approved projects for the year will be made available around mid-September. You'll receive a survey in the first week of class to choose your top choices. If your own project was approved, you'll be automatically assigned to it. 

By the end of week 1, the instruction team will assign every student to a project and team. As soon as these appear in Canvas, you should start talking to your new team and get organized.

:::caution
Students should discuss how the project will be evaluatuated at the end of each term. Our project partners receive a survey with very specific rubrics. Their evaluation is worth 25% of the final grade.
:::

Once you talk to your team, the first step is **to reach out to and meet your project partner or mentor**. Through them, get clarifications on the project, expectations, deliverables, and start figuring out the timeline. Make them aware of the main assignments this term as well as the grading rubrics. All the information is available in the handbook. The handbook is subject to small changes; always refer to Canvas for current assignments.

## Can I Assure My Spot on a Project?

Generally, no. Some exceptions:

- You submitted your own project.
- Your project partner submitted a project in collaboration with you.

## I Want to Know More About a Specific Project

Some project partners allow students to contact them to get more information about their projects (but not reserve a spot, that's up to the instruction team). It will be clear from the project description if you can do so.
