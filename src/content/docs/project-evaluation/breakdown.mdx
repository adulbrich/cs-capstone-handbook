In the Capstone series, your project partner will evaluate your team on different facets, as listed below. 

Each course will have a different grade distribution based on the project progress.

For example, CS461 puts more emphasis on Requirements & Specifications, while CS463 focuses more on Verification & Validation.

Facet | CS461 | CS462 | CS463
------|-------|-------|------
Reflection (learning outcomes, feedback, impact, IP, etc.) | 15% | 15% | 15%
Requirements and Specifications | **40%** | 15% | 5%
Design, Implementation, and Deployment | 15% | **40%** | 20%
Verification and Validation (outcome) | 5% | 10% | **40%**
Teamwork | 15% | 10% | 10%
Communication (abstract, demo, presentation) | 10% | 10% | 10%

If you change project during the series, we won't adjust the distribution accordingly, and you'll probably have to put extra effort in to meet the expectations and get a good final grade.
