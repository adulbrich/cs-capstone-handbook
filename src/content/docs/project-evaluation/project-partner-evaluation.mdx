This page covers **project partner evaluations**, which account for 25% of student's total grade. Project partners will assess their team(s) twice each term:

1. A short **Midterm Evaluation** (5% of total grade) focusing on responsiveness, professionalism, and delivery quality.
2. The **Final Evaluation** (20% of total grade) uses the six facets described below to assess overall project progress and outcomes.

Project partner assessments use different approaches depending on the term. In Fall and Winter, the evaluation is **progress-focused** using adapted criteria that assess development milestones and learning growth. In Spring, the evaluation shifts to **an outcome-focused approach** that assesses final deliverables and project outcomes. Each facet will have a different weight depending on the term, see the [grade distribution](/project-evaluation/breakdown).

**Students should discuss expectations with their project partner or mentor at the beginning of each term and review progress regularly.**

The evaluation will be colletected **through survey sent to each project partner**. The end-of-term survey will include the six facets below, each with its own rubric.

## Reflection

The purpose of the Reflection facet is to evaluate your ability to critically analyze learnings and project experiences.

<Tabs syncKey="terms">
  <TabItem label="Fall & Winter">
    Points | Criteria
    -------|---------
    100    | Demonstrates clear learning progression and applies insights to improve team processes. Regular reflection evident.
    90     | Shows good learning progression with some application of insights. Regular reflection with minor gaps.
    80     | Adequate learning progression. Basic reflection on experiences with some insights.
    70     | Limited learning progression. Minimal reflection with general observations.
    50     | No clear learning progression. Lacks meaningful reflection.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Spring">
    Points | Criteria
    -------|---------
    100    | Demonstrates deep critical thinking, learning, and insight with specific examples. Identifies future improvements.
    90     | Shows clear critical thinking, learning, and insight. Provides some specific examples and suggestions for improvement.
    80     | Reflects on learning and experiences with general insights. May lack specific examples or suggestions.
    70     | Basic reflection on experiences. Limited insights and general observations.
    50     | Minimal reflection. Lacks depth, examples, and insights.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Requirements and Specifications

The purpose of the Requirements and Specifications facet is to evaluate your ability to gather, document, and prioritize project requirements.

<Tabs syncKey="terms">
  <TabItem label="Fall & Winter">
    Points | Criteria
    -------|---------
    100    | Requirements gathering shows clear progress and stakeholder engagement. Well-documented evolution of understanding.
    90     | Good progress in requirements gathering. Most stakeholder needs identified with documentation improving.
    80     | Adequate progress in requirements. Basic stakeholder engagement with some documentation.
    70     | Limited progress in requirements gathering. Minimal stakeholder engagement.
    50     | No clear progress in requirements. Stakeholder needs remain unclear.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Spring">
    Points | Criteria
    -------|---------
    100    | Requirements are comprehensive, well-documented, and prioritized. Stakeholder needs are thoroughly addressed.
    90     | Requirements are detailed and mostly well-documented. Stakeholder needs are largely addressed.
    80     | Requirements are clear but may lack some detail or prioritization. Stakeholder needs are generally addressed.
    70     | Basic requirements documented. Some stakeholder needs may be overlooked.
    50     | Minimal requirements documented. Many stakeholder needs are missing or unclear.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Stakeholders refers to the project partners, which can be faculty members, students, industry partners, or else. Make sure that the goals of the project are stated, clear, and measurable. We can't evaluate requirements otherwise.

## Design, Implementation, and Deployment

This rubric is very broad and we don't expect to hit a hundred points before Winter or Spring. Fall term does not put a lot of weight on this rubric, but your goal is still to get the implementation and deployment under way to hit the ground running in Winter.

<Tabs syncKey="terms">
  <TabItem label="Fall & Winter">
    Points | Criteria
    -------|---------
    100    | Significant progress in design and implementation. Clear development milestones achieved with good documentation.
    90     | Good progress with most milestones met. Implementation advancing steadily with adequate documentation.
    80     | Adequate progress with some milestones met. Basic implementation progress.
    70     | Limited progress. Few milestones achieved with minimal implementation.
    50     | No clear progress. Implementation has not advanced meaningfully.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Spring">
    Points | Criteria
    -------|---------
    100    | Solution design is innovative, well-thought-out, and thoroughly implemented. Deployment is smooth and well-documented.
    90     | Design is solid and implementation is mostly complete. Deployment is successful with minor issues.
    80     | Design is adequate and implementation is functional. Deployment is successful but may have some issues.
    70     | Basic design and implementation. Deployment is functional but with notable issues.
    50     | Minimal design and incomplete implementation. Deployment is problematic or incomplete.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We use the term "deployment" very loosely here. If you have a research project, this means that your code or artifacts are well-documented (think reusable/reproducible). If you have a FOSS project, it means your patches include all the necessary changes (incl. to documentation) and successfully works within the existing codebase with no regression.

## Verification and Validation

The Verification and Validation facet looks at the **outcome** of your Capstone project, not just the output.

In Spring, the grading scale is different depending on the project **category**. If your project does not fit any category or if your project partner has other expectations, they will be able to provide a custom grade on the scale [50,100]. **Please set expectations with your project partner at the beginning of each term.**

{/* TODO: figure out if this facet should be team-based on individually assessed */}

Capstone is fundamentally a team effort. Teamwork will be judged on the team and individual level.

In addition to the general rubric for teamwork, we're also using the Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (CATME). The [CATME Five Teamwork Dimensions](https://info.catme.org/features/catme-five-dimensions/) will only be used for intra-groups peer reviews.
