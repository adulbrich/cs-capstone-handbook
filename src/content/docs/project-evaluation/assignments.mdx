## Project Abstract

:::note
The project abstract is a key individual WIC assessment happening in CS461. 
:::

Your abstract serves as a crucial introduction and summary of your project. It should adhere to the following guidelines:

- approximately 300 words;
- primarily text-based (limited use of figures, tables, formulas, etc.);
- written mostly in present tense;
- minimize jargon and acronyms;
- ensure proper grammar and spelling.

The abstract will be used over the course of the academic year when introducing your project, e.g., documents, demos, etc. You will revise this abstract as a team later in the term. The abstract should align with the vision set by your project partner.

The abstract should address the following five key points:

### Opportunity & Problem

What opportunity does your software address? Who will use it? What specific technical problem does it solve? Be as clear, specific, and factual as possible. Here are some made-up examples:

- "Over 70% of mobile app users report concerns about data privacy, yet 50% of apps fail to provide clear consent options for data collection, leading to increased distrust and app abandonment."
- "Nonprofits lose nearly 20% of potential donor contributions due to outdated donation tracking systems, resulting in missed opportunities for growth and program development."

### Objective

What is the goal of your project within this context? The objective should be broad enough to allow for multiple design solutions to be considered.

### Plausible Design Approach

While multiple solutions may be possible, start with one initial design approach. This may evolve as the project develops and could differ by the end. Highlight key design challenges and the advanced technical knowledge needed to address them.

### Expected Benefits Over Existing Alternatives

Clearly outline at least one advantage your design has over existing solutions. Be specific. Here are some made-up examples:

- "Our app includes a transparent, easy-to-understand consent management dashboard, giving users full control over their data permissions, which existing alternatives lack by providing only basic or hidden privacy settings."
- "Unlike traditional donation tracking systems that require manual updates, our system automatically tracks donations in real-time and integrates with CRM tools, helping nonprofits increase donor retention by 20%."

### Summary of (Expected) Results

What evidence have you or will you collect to demonstrate that the objective has been met? Note that this will change depending on your [project category](/project-evaluation/rubrics/#verification-and-validation/).

## Team Charter or Working Agreement

:::note
The team charter is a key summative assessment of your CS Capstone course, and is happening at the end of CS 461. This document should be reviewed regularly and submitted every term with a changelog and reflection, if any.
:::

The team charter is a must for high performing teams. It sets clear expectations and guidelines for how your team members will collaborate and operate throughout the project. 

The charter will develop a sense of shared responsibility, increase one own awareness, empower the team to lead according to agreements, and enhance the quality of the team process.

The agreements in the charter will work well when:

- they are important to you, 
- they are limited in number, 
- they are fully supported by everyone, 
- the team is reminded of agreements during process checks,
- the team is reminded of agreements when they are broken.

You would be surprised how many times that last one does not happen.

The team charter should be reviewed every term, or after retrospectives, whatever comes first. Make sure to document updates to your charter (for example by versioning it, or exporting new versions to PDF, or adding a change log at the beginning of the document).

Check the resources below to figure out what to put in the team charter:

- [Team Friction Inspires Working Agreements](https://agilepainrelief.com/blog/team-friction-inspires-working-agreements.html)
- [Creating a Team Working Agreement](https://www.scrum.org/resources/creating-team-working-agreement)

Here's a high level list of items you can explore:

- purpose and goals
- meeting guidelines
- team composition and roles
- norms and values
- decision-making process
- work plan and tasks
- software development process
- tooling
- communication and feedback
- accountability and performance
- review and revision

Some of these items can be considered from an internal perspective (within the team) or from an external one (with project partner, users, or instruction team).

Put together a list of items for your team agreement. Choose 5 items to prioritize. Choose items that the team needs to work on. Probably most of the items on your list are good for most teams, but your team might already be doing well implicitly on many of them. Explain why you are focusing on these 5 items.

## Requirements Document

:::note
The requirements document is a key summative assessment of your CS Capstone course, and is happening at the end of CS 461. This document should be reviewed regularly and submitted every term with a changelog and reflection, if any.
:::

## Design Document

:::note
The design document is a key summative assessment of your CS Capstone course, and is happening at the end of CS 462. This document should be reviewed regularly and re-submitted in Spring with a changelog and reflection, if any. 
{/* You are welcome to already submit it in Fall. */}
:::

## Fall, Winter, and Spring Peer Evaluations

## Fall, Winter, and Spring Demos

## Fall and Winter Retrospectives

## Documentation

## Engineering Expo

## Project Retrospective

:::note
The project retrospective is a key summative assessment of your CS Capstone course, and is happening at the end of CS 463. 
:::

A comprehensive project retrospective should cover multiple aspects of the project lifecycle, providing a detailed analysis of what went well, what didn't, and how future projects can be improved.

We explain below what should be included in the document. You can adapt the contents based on your project category.

We will use your project retrospective as reflection activities for our future CS Capstone students.
