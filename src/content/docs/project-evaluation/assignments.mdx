## Project Abstract



## Team Charter or Working Agreement

:::note
The team charter is a key summative assessment of your CS Capstone course, and is happening at the end of CS 461. This document should be reviewed regularly and submitted every term with a changelog and reflection, if any.
:::

The team charter is a must for high performing teams. It sets clear expectations and guidelines for how your team members will collaborate and operate throughout the project. 

The charter will develop a sense of shared responsibility, increase one own awareness, empower the team to lead according to agreements, and enhance the quality of the team process.

The agreements in the charter will work well when:

- they are important to you, 
- they are limited in number, 
- they are fully supported by everyone, 
- the team is reminded of agreements during process checks,
- the team is reminded of agreements when they are broken.

You would be surprised how many times that last one does not happen.

The team charter should be reviewed every term, or after retrospectives, whatever comes first. Make sure to document updates to your charter (for example by versioning it, or exporting new versions to PDF, or adding a change log at the beginning of the document).

Check the resources below to figure out what to put in the team charter:

- [Team Friction Inspires Working Agreements](https://agilepainrelief.com/blog/team-friction-inspires-working-agreements.html)
- [Creating a Team Working Agreement](https://www.scrum.org/resources/creating-team-working-agreement)

Put together a list of items for your team agreement. Choose 5 items to prioritize. Choose items that the team needs to work on. Probably most of the items on your list are good for most teams, but your team might already be doing well implicitly on many of them. Explain why you are focusing on these 5 items.

## Requirements Document

## Design Document

:::note
The design document is a key summative assessment of your CS Capstone course, and is happening at the end of CS 462. This document should be reviewed regularly and re-submitted in Spring with a changelog and reflection, if any. 
{/* You are welcome to already submit it in Fall. */}

## Fall, Winter, and Spring Peer Evaluations

## Fall, Winter, and Spring Demos

## Fall and Winter Retrospectives

## Documentation

## Engineering Expo

## Project Retrospective

:::note
The project retrospective is a key summative assessment of your CS Capstone course, and is happening at the end of CS 463. 
:::

A comprehensive project retrospective should cover multiple aspects of the project lifecycle, providing a detailed analysis of what went well, what didn't, and how future projects can be improved.

We explain below what should be included in the document. You can adapt the contents based on your project category.

We will use your project retrospective as reflection activities for our future CS Capstone students.
