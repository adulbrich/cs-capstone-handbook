The Verification and Validation facet looks at the **outcome** of your Capstone project, not just the output.

Each project category has a different grading scale, inherent to the category.

90     | Patches accepted
85     | Patches accepted but then reverted due to bug/issue
80     | Patches submitted and reviewed
75     | Patches submitted
70     | Patch appears to work on student computers
50     | Patch is vaporware
