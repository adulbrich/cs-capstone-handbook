In the Capstone series, you will be evaluated on different facets, as listed below.

Each course will have a different grade distribution based on the project progress.

For example, CS461 puts more emphasis on Requirements & Specifications, while CS463 focuses more on Verification & Validation.

Facet | CS461 | CS462 | CS463
------|-------|-------|------
Reflection (learning outcomes, feedback, impact, IP, etc.) | 15% | 15% | 15%
Requirements and Specifications | **40%** | 15% | 5%
Design, Implementation, and Deployment | 15% | **40%** | 20%
Verification and Validation (outcome) | 5% | 10% | **40%**
Teamwork | 15% | 10% | 10%
Communication (abstract, demo, presentation) | 10% | 10% | 10%

If you change project during the series, we won't adjust the distribution accordingly, and you'll probably have to put extra effort in to meet the expectations and get a good final grade.

## Assignment Matrix

Here's the summative assignment matrix for each term, including which assignment fulfills which learning outcome(s). Some assignments like the career activities don't count toward final grade but are required to get your grade.
