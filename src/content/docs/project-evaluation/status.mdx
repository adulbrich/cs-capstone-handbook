Every term, we ask you to update the project status sheet, date it, and submit it. Include a [changelog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog) at the beginning. Here's a template.

## Project and Team Identification

List your team and projects names (can be the same), student names and contact information, and write a project abstract. This information should not change too much over time.

### Opportunity Assessment

- What do ou want to learn? This can be slightly different for each team member but hopefully there's at least one commonality.
- Why does the world need your project? Why is now the right time to do it? Has something changed in the world to create this opportunity now? Is this a longstanding opportunity?
- List the advantages that your project has.
- List some strategies to mitigate challenges that you may face.

Here are some advantages and challenges faced by teams in the past:

Advantages | Challenges
---------- | ----------
Knowledgeable project partner or mentor | High uncertainty
Using novel technologies or data sources | Difficult to access data or learn new technologies
Opportunity or problem is clear | Scope is too large/too small/unclear
User segment is clear | High competition / dense market

## Project Reflection

List all reflection activities done up to that point, either individually or as a team, and a summary of the learnings you got from them and how it applies to your project.

Name | Date | Activity | Learnings
---- | ---- | -------- | ---------
Joe K. | ... | Read the Phoenix Project | ...
Team  | ... | Watched The Social Dilemma | ...

## Peer Feedback

List your responses to the feedback received from your project partners, mentors, instruction team, and other students.

Party | Date | Focus | Outcome 
----- | ---- | ----- | -------
