Generally speaking, capstone projects should, in all relevant ways:

- exemplify the learning objectives;
- demonstrate the skills expected of a graduate;
- make appropriate trade-offs and judgments; and
- not suffer serious oversights.

A central premise is that the software should perform its intended function properly and in a unified way.

Here's how we'll convert your points to your letter grade. The `Points` column denotes the minimum amount of point to get the grade, e.g., 95 points or more will get you an `A`, less than 60 points will land you an `F`.

Letter Grade | Points | Description
-------------|--------|------------
A  | 94 | demonstrates mastery on all learning objectives, with no oversights
A- | 90 | demonstrates mastery on most learning objectives, with some minor oversights
B+ | 85 | adequacy on all learning objectives, mastery of some, with some minor oversights
B  | 80 | adequacy on all learning objectives, with some minor oversights
B- | 75 | adequacy on all learning objectives, with some serious oversights
C  | 70 | adequacy on most learning objectives, with some serious oversights
D  | 60 | significant shortcomings in learning objectives, major oversights
F  | <60| unethical, unprofessional, incomplete, etc.
