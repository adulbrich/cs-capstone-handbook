## Incoming Seniors

As students planning to take the CS46X series, you probably have lots of questions. We'll try to clear some of them for you.

### What Are My Course Options?

We have different Capstone options:

- **CS 46X (461/462/463), 3 terms, on-campus CS Capstone** (this handbook)
- CS 46X (461/462/463), 3 terms, online CS Capstone
- CS 467, 1 term, online CS Capstone
- ECE 44X (441/442/443), 3 terms, on-campus ECE Capstone
- ENGR 41X (415/416), 2 terms, multidisciplinary Capstone
- CS 428, 1 term, cybersecurity Capstone
- Vertically Integrated Projects, multi-year

You can [check some of the previous projects](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/pages/browseProjects.php) (and filter by course). Cybersecurity is not covered in the project listing page.

### What Kinds of Projects Are Available?

For the CS46X, we have a have four possible project categories:

- Free and Open Source Software (FOSS): contribute meaningful patches to an existing FOSS project
- Consultancy: develop a software solution for a client (company, faculty, etc.) that will be deployed to production
- New Product or Game: create a product or game and gather actual users (entrepreneurial spirit required)
- Research: work on a research hypothesis with the goal of publishing a paper

We reach out to external parties to find enough consultancy, advanced technologies, and research projects for the next academic year.

If you have your own project idea (can be of any categories but you need a project partner or mentor), you can [submit the project](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/pages/) for review before end of August. If accepted, you'll be able to work on that project with some of your peers.

Please note that [each category will be graded differently](/project-evaluation/outcome/), and some categories will require more effort than others.

### When Can I Choose a Project and Whom Will I Paired With?

The list of approved projects will be published in early September, right before the start of Fall term. You'll be able to submit your preferences at the start of the term and we will pair you up with like minded peers.

If you submitted a project and it was approved, you will be assigned to it automatically. It might not even show up in our project list if you already have a team.

### What Kind of Class is This?

Compared to previous classes, the Capstone series is a medium-term team project. You will have to plan and execute work over the course of 9 months (starting in Fall term and ending in Spring term).

You *cannot* approach this class as a regular, assignment-based, class. If you tackle assignments last minute, you *will fail this class*.

You haven't done much in terms of longer team projects, up to now. The Capstone series aims to address this shortcoming and give you the necessary skills to plan and strive under uncertainty. Depending on the project category, your success will depend solely on your capacity to adapt and deliver.
