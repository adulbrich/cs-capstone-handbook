## Incoming Seniors

As students planning to take the CS46X series, you probably have lots of questions. We'll try to clear some of them for you.

### What Are My Course Options?

We have an on-campus CS Capstone series (CS46X, this handbook), an online version (CS467), multidisciplinary projects (ENGR41X), vertically integrated projects, ECE capstone (for EE majors), and a cybersecurity capstone (for security majors).

You can [check some of the previous projects](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/pages/browseProjects.php) (and filter by course).

### What Kinds of Projects Are Available?

For the CS46X, we have a have [five possible project categories](/project-selection/categories/).

We reach out to external parties to find enough consultancy, advanced technologies, and research projects for the next academic year.

If you have your own project idea (can be of any categories but you need a project partner or mentor), you can [submit the project](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/pages/) for review before end of August. If accepted, you'll be able to work on that project with some of your peers.

Please note that [each category will be graded differently](/project-evaluation/outcome/), and some categories will require more effort than others.

### When Can I Choose a Project?

The list of approved projects will be published in early September, right before the start of Fall term. You'll be able to submit your preferences at the start of the term and we will pair you up with like minded peers.

If you submitted a project and it was approved, you will be assigned to it.
