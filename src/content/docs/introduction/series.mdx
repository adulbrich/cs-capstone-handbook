Senior Software Engineering Project I, II, and III, collectively known as the Capstone series, represent the culmination of our students' academic journey.

Capstone | Class Name | Credits
---------|------------|--------
CS 461   | Senior Software Engineering Project I   | 3
CS 462   | Senior Software Engineering Project II  | 3
CS 463   | Senior Software Engineering Project III | 2

This three-course sequence transforms aspiring developers into industry-ready software engineers through real-world project experience and professional collaboration.

## How We Measure Success

Our evaluation framework ensures accountability and growth across multiple dimensions. Students receive feedback from project partners or mentors (25%), peers (25%), and instructors (50%) across these critical areas:

- Reflection
- Requirements and Specifications
- Design, Implementation, and Deployment
- Verification and Validation
- Teamwork
- Communication

The emphasis on each area evolves throughout the series to mirror real-world project progression and professional development.

## CS 461: Foundation & Planning

Students are matched with projects and teams, launching their capstone journey with a focus on **requirements gathering and specifications**. This foundational course emphasizes understanding stakeholder needs and translating them into technical requirements. Students deliver an **initial working prototype** that demonstrates core functionality and validates key assumptions.

## CS 462: Development & Iteration

The heart of the development cycle. Students dive deep into **design, implementation, and deployment** while refining their understanding of project requirements. Through iterative development cycles and robust project management practices, teams build toward a production-ready solution.

## CS 463: Delivery & Validation

The final course focuses on **verification, validation, and project outcomes**. Students polish their solutions, conduct thorough testing, and prepare comprehensive documentation. This 2-credit course emphasizes delivering professional-quality results and demonstrating measurable project success.

Most technical development is completed in CS 462, allowing CS 463 to focus on refinement and validation.
