<Badge text="New Product" variant="note" class="my-6" size="small"/>
<Badge text="Web" variant="success" class="my-6" size="small"/>

Lavender is a digital platform designed to manage shift-related sleep challenges by allowing users to track and visualize daily sleep entries, work and activity schedules, and sleep quality trends, while providing personalized support through custom sleep schedule recommendations, insights to reduce fatigue and insomnia, and tools for provider collaboration. 

![](../../../assets/2024-lavender.png)

The platform enables providers to monitor sleep patterns, view sleep diary entries, track key sleep metrics, and access activity logs, offering auto-generated optimized sleep schedules based on research or manually added custom recommendations that can be sent directly to participants' calendars.

<Badge text="Graphics" variant="success" class="my-6" size="small"/>

The Robot Underground™ aims to break open tech education for middle and high schoolers everywhere, even if they live in a robot wasteland. 

![](../../../assets/2024-robot-underground.png)

The team built a demo for an immersive robotics video game that catapults the player into a world of building, wiring, and programming increasingly difficult robots in order to unravel a tantalizing mystery.

Built on top of a [comprehensive robotics curriculum](https://robotunderground.party/), players can walk in with zero skills and walk out prepared to dive into a technical college major.

<Badge text="AR/VR" variant="success" class="my-6" size="small"/>
<Badge text="Visualization" variant="success" class="my-6" size="small"/>

Helping Veterinary students learn anatomy through an environment that allows for immersive, collaborative studying in VR.

![](../../../assets/2023-immersive-animal-anatomy.jpg)

Studying anatomy in VR offers an interactive, hands-on experience that allows users to engage with models in a dynamic way, unlike static textbook learning. In this virtual environment, users can explore, move, and manipulate anatomical structures, making it easier to understand complex details through direct interaction.

The [Immersive Animal Anatomy Visualizer](https://extended-reality-lab.github.io/projects/immersive-animal-anatomy-visualizer) is distributed via the Oculus App Lab, this means updates/changes can be easily downloaded by users like any other applications on the Oculus Quest 2.

## Spatiotemporal Temperature Fusion Network & StarFM (2023-2024)

<Badge text="Research" variant="note" class="my-6" size="small"/>
<Badge text="Simulation" variant="success" class="my-6" size="small"/>

Using machine learning to turn unreadable or missing satellite images into usable and rich data.

![](../../../assets/2023-sttfn-osu.png)

The Spatiotemporal Temperature Fusion Network (STTFN) is a multiscale convolutional neural network used for modeling nonlinear relationships in Land Surface Temperature (LST) satellite imagery. It predicts missing or damaged data by using two convolutional networks to generate forward and backward sequences, inferring a “middle” sequence. The model leverages MODIS (low-resolution) and Landsat (high-resolution) satellite data to estimate high-quality LST images. The implementation, trained on Oregon State University's HPC Clusters, uses metrics like RMSE and SSIM for performance and includes a comparison with the STARFM model.
