As an industry professional, entrepreneur, and/or faculty or staff member, we thank you for helping our students acquire valuable skills to help them for their next career move.

We also hope that our students will delight you with their work and meet agreed-upon expectations.


## Submitting a Project

We are always looking for challenging, fun, and interesting projects for our students. There are several possible [projects categories](/project-selection/categories/) for student to pick from. Each category come with their own [evaluation criteria](/project-evaluation/rubrics/#verification-and-validation).

If you haven't submitted a project already, [head over here](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/pages/).

Having your project approved and picked by our students won't cost you anything but some time every week. We recommend that you submit project ideas that are *not* critical to the success of your organization in the short-term.

## What We Expect From You

As a project partner or mentor, we ask:

- availability from the beginning of Fall term until the end of Spring term;
- at least 1 hour of your time each week to meet with students and answer their questions;
- technical guidance from you or someone in your organization;
- to review students' work and test their prototypes/software when they request it;
- to validate their work each term based on different [facets](/project-evaluation/breakdown/) and their [rubrics](/project-evaluation/rubrics/);  check the [Academic Calendar](https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/osu-academic-calendar) for the term dates.

You are welcome to attend the public [Engineering Expo](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/events/expo) in June (website will be updated closer to the event date).

## What You Can Expect From Us

As the instruction team, we will:

- assign students to your project(s) based on a bidding survey in week 0 of Fall term;
- share your email address with the students so that they contact you by week 2 of Fall term at the latest;
- help students organize and manage their project by providing relevant [assignments](/project-evaluation/assignments/) throughout the academic year;
- send over surveys for you to grade your team(s) based on set rubrics;
- be available if you have questions or concerns about the students or coursework.

Learn more about the [Capstone Series](/learning-objectives/series/).

You can always email us at [cs-46x-help@oregonstate.edu](cs-46x-help@oregonstate.edu).

## Intellectual Property and Non-Disclosure Agreements

By default, students hold the Intellectual Property (IP) of the work performed during Capstone. Not the university, nor the project partners. 

Similarly, by default, students will be graded on their work by both the Capstone instruction team and their project partner(s). In the case of an Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), the instruction team will be limited in their grading capacity, and might require a little more involvement from the project partner. The instruction team cannot sign an NDA.

When submitting a project, you can mention that your project requires either an Intellectual Property Agreement (IPA), a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), or both. 

Students generally like open-source projects because they can showcase those in their portfolio. If you're interested in making your project open-source, here's some [guides](https://github.com/readme/guides/open-source-licensing) to help you [choose an open source license](https://choosealicense.com/)
