As an industry professional, entrepreneur, and/or faculty or staff member, we thank you for helping our students acquire valuable skills to help them for their next career move.

We also hope that our students will delight you with their work and meet agreed-upon expectations.

## Submitting a Project

We are always looking for challenging, fun, and interesting projects for our students. There are several possible [projects categories](/practicalities/categories/) for student to pick from. Each category come with their own [evaluation criteria](/project-evaluation/rubrics/#verification-and-validation).

If you haven't submitted a project already, [head over here](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/pages/).

Having your project approved and picked by our students won't cost you anything but some time every week. We recommend that you submit project ideas that are *not* critical to the success of your organization in the short-term.

### Submitting Multiple Projects

If you are representing a *company*, you'll be encouraged to join our [INSPiRE Industry Affiliates](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/EECS/alumni-industry/student-engagement/inspire) program. In addition to multiple Capstone teams, you can access a number of other perks.

Individual side projects or smaller entities will not be approached for donation.

If you are working for OSU, you can submit multiple projects.

## What We Expect From You

As a project partner or mentor, we ask:

- availability from the beginning of Fall term until the end of Spring term;
- at least 1 hour of your time each week to meet with students and answer their questions;
- technical guidance from you or someone in your organization;
- to set, together with the students, clear expectations about the work to be completed and how you will evaluate it (see [rubrics](/project-evaluation/rubrics/) for ideas),
- to review students' work and test their prototypes/software when they request it;
- to validate their work each term based on different [facets](/project-evaluation/breakdown/) and their [rubrics](/project-evaluation/rubrics/);  check the [Academic Calendar](https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/osu-academic-calendar) for the term dates.

The [rubrics](/project-evaluation/rubrics/) are here to help us grade students' work each term but we understand that they might not fit your specific project. We're leaving their interpretation to your discretion each term. Align your expectations with the students.

You are welcome to attend the public [Engineering Expo](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/events/expo) in June (website will be updated closer to the event date).

## What You Can Expect From Us

As the instruction team, we will:

- assign students to your project(s) based on a bidding survey in week 0 of Fall term;
- share your email address with the students so that they contact you by week 2 of Fall term at the latest;
- help students organize and manage their project by providing relevant [assignments](/project-evaluation/assignments/) throughout the academic year;
- send over surveys for you to grade your team(s) based on set rubrics;
- be available if you have questions or concerns about the students or coursework.

Learn more about the [Capstone Series](/learning-objectives/series/).

You can always email us at [cs-46x-help@oregonstate.edu](mailto:cs-46x-help@oregonstate.edu).

## What You Can Expect From Students

Fall and Winter terms are 3 credits courses, Spring is 2 credits.

One credit represents 30 hours of the average student's time that includes work in and out of class to meet the intended course learning outcomes and which are verified by evidence of student achievement in a course.

That means we expect each individual student to work on average 9 hours per week on the project in Fall and Winter. It might take them more time to excel, though.

These 9 hours include one hour of class time (workshops to help them get started), meetings, assignments (supporting the project), plus any work that needs doing to complete the project.

## Major Assignments

All assignments in this course are generally common in most companies employing software engineers. They are designed to help students learn how to work in a team, communicate effectively, and deliver a product that meets the needs of the project partner. 

We also use them to make sure that our students meet the school accreditation requirements.

While we have recommended activities and provide guidance to the contents of the assignments, we hope that you will work with the students to ensure that the deliverables are tailored to your project and that the students are meeting your expectations. 

Your assessment of their performance at the end of the term will be based on the quality of the work they deliver, as well as their ability to work effectively as a team and communicate with you.

Here's the list of major assignments the students have to turn in:

- Team Charter or WOrking Agreement: due early Fall term, revisions throughout the year if warranted
- Requirements Document: due early Fall term, revisions throughout the year if warranted
- Design Document: due mid-Fall term, revisions throughout the year if warranted
- Team Retrospectives: due at the end of each term
- "Code Releases": due at the end of each term
- Project Presentations: due at the end of each term
- Project Retrospective: due at the end of Spring term

[You can find more details about them on this page.](/project-evaluation/assignments/)

## Intellectual Property and Non-Disclosure Agreements

By default, students hold the Intellectual Property (IP) of the work performed during Capstone. Not the university, nor the project partners. 

Similarly, by default, students will be graded on their work by both the Capstone instruction team and their project partner(s). In the case of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), the instruction team will be limited in their grading capacity, and might require a little more involvement from the project partner. The instruction team cannot sign an NDA.

When submitting a project, you can mention that your project requires either an Intellectual Property Agreement (IPA), a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), or both. 

Students generally like open-source projects because they can showcase those in their portfolio. If you're interested in making your project open-source, here's some [guides](https://github.com/readme/guides/open-source-licensing) to help you [choose an open source license](https://choosealicense.com/)
