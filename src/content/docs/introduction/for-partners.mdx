As an industry professional, entrepreneur, and/or faculty or staff member, we thank you for helping our students acquire valuable skills to help them for their next career move.

We also hope that our students will delight you with their work and meet agreed-upon expectations.

## What We Expect From You

As a project partner or mentor, we ask:

- availability from the beginning of Fall term until the end of Spring term;
- at least 1 hour of your time each week to meet with students and answer their questions;
- technical guidance from you or someone in your organization;
- to review students' work and test their prototypes/software when they request it;
- to validate their work on a [category-dependent scale](/project-evaluation/outcome/).
