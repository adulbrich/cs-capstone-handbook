This handbook is the work of [Alexander Ulbrich](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/alexander-ulbrich) in his capacity of instructor at Oregon State University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Many thanks to [Kirsten Winters](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/kirsten-winters) and [Bill Pfeil](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/william-pfeil) for their input and their help reviewing the contents.

This handbook is inspired by the [Software Engineering Capstone Design Project Handbook](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~se_capstone/se-capstone-handbook.pdf) from the University of Waterloo.

We use LLMs to review the contents for typos and grammar issues, as well as generating meta descriptions and ideas. The handbook uses [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) to generate the static site. The source is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/adulbrich/cs-capstone-handbook).
