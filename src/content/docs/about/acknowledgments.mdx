This handbook is the work of [Alexander Ulbrich](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/alexander-ulbrich) in his capacity of instructor at Oregon State University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Many thanks to [Kirsten Winters](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/kirsten-winters) and [Bill Pfeil](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/william-pfeil) for their input and their help reviewing the contents.

This handbook is inspired by the [Software Engineering Capstone Design Project Handbook](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~se_capstone/se-capstone-handbook.pdf) from the University of Waterloo.

This handbook was in part written in collaboration with ChatGPT for ideation and revisions, and to help write meta descriptions for completed pages.
