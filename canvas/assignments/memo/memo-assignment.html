<div style="background-color: #d3d3d3; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px 15px; margin: 10px 0px;">
    <p>While this is an individual submission assignment, you are expected to <strong>meet with your project partner or mentor as a team</strong>. We want each student to first look at the problem and project from their own individual perspective.</p>
</div>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Practice professional information-gathering and note-taking with an external stakeholder.</li>
    <li>Translate the discussion into a clear problem statement, constraints, and expectations.</li>
    <li>Discover and address IP, licensing, and data-use considerations early to avoid rework.</li>
    <li>Communicate findings concisely in a one-page technical/business memo.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><strong>Deliverable, Audience and Genre</strong>: A one-page internal memo to your project team and instructor that captures project partners intake discussion evidence and decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Allowed Resources</strong>: calendar/meet tools, note-taking/transcription (optional), style/grammar aids, team repo/docs, <span>and&nbsp;</span><span>Generative AI tools for idea generation, editing, organization, and phrasing</span><span>. Do not fabricate evidence (e.g., fake citations).</span></p>
<p><span>Check the handbook's <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://capstone.alexulbrich.com/activities/creative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative</a> and <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://capstone.alexulbrich.com/activities/planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planning</a> activities to get started. Depending on your situation and your stakeholder(s), some of these activities might be more useful than others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Plan the project partner intake session.</strong> Draft goals and 6&ndash;10 questions; align with your team. Obtain consent to record, if applicable. Take notes.</li>
    <li><strong>Lead or co-lead the discussion with your project partner.</strong> Capture direct quotes or timestamped paraphrases. Note consent/recording status.</li>
    <li><strong>Synthesize the problem &amp; constraints.</strong> Write a clear problem statement plus initial constraints/acceptance criteria derived from the intake session.</li>
    <li><strong>Identify IP/licensing &amp; data-use items.</strong> Note who owns what (code, content, data), any expected license(s), and privacy/security implications; include immediate next steps (e.g., &ldquo;confirm with sponsor whether GPL is acceptable&rdquo;).</li>
    <li><strong>Capture project partner expectations.</strong> Document deliverables, success measures, communication cadence, availability/SLAs, tools, and any &ldquo;must/must-not&rdquo; items; confirm via a brief follow-up email. Please <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://capstone.alexulbrich.com/project-evaluation/project-partner-evaluation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discuss the six facets</a> you will be <a title="Project Partner Survey" href="https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/2017718/assignments/10265736" data-course-type="assignments" data-published="true" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/api/v1/courses/2017718/assignments/10265736" data-api-returntype="Assignment">evaluated on at the end of the term</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Write the memo.</strong> One page, scannable headings/bullets, working links, professional tone.</li>
    <li><strong>Package and submit.</strong> Include supporting evidence listed below. Keep sensitive details out of public repos; pseudonymize if needed.</li>
</ol>
<div style="background-color: #d3d3d3; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px 15px; margin: 10px 0px;">
    <p>If your project is student-led, please discuss these items as a team, then review your discussion with your project mentor. In that case, quotes can be taken from any students on the team or from the project mentor.</p>

<h2>Quality Checklist</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Did you plan a purposeful intake discussion with a brief plan, usable notes, and 5&ndash;10 grounded quotes/timestamps, with consent/recording status noted?</li>
    <li>Does your problem statement reflect stakeholder language and include concrete initial constraints/acceptance criteria you can test?</li>
    <li>Have you correctly identified early IP/licensing/data considerations and listed realistic next steps?</li>
    <li>Are stakeholder expectations explicit (deliverables, measures, cadence, availability) and verified via a short confirmation email?</li>
    <li>Is the memo one page, skimmable, link-checked, and professional; do grammar/style not impede meaning?</li>
    <li>What&rsquo;s the strongest piece of evidence? What key decision lacks evidence?</li>
    <li>Are any constraints or expectations ambiguous? Rewrite one for testability.</li>
    <li>Do IP/licensing/data notes suggest any risks the team should mitigate this term?</li>
</ul>
<p>See the Canvas rubric for detailed performance levels.</p>
<h2>Reflection (optional, ~5&ndash;8 min)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What did you learn about the stakeholder&rsquo;s real success criteria? What will you verify next?</li>
    <li>Which constraint or IP/licensing item could block progress later? What&rsquo;s your mitigation plan?</li>
</ul>
