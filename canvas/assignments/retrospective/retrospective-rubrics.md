# Retrospective - Rubrics

## Team narrative: successes and pain points (8 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (8 to >6.5 pts): Clearly identifies top 3 successes and top 3 pain points; descriptions are specific and non-generic.

- **Exceeds Expectations** (8 to >6.5 pts): Reads as a coherent narrative with synthesis (not a status list); shows prioritization and a clear “story of the term.”
- **Meets Expectations** (6.5 to >1.5 pts): Mostly coherent; some sections drift into status updates.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.5 to >0 pts): Primarily a status list.

## Evidence: relevance to narrative claims (6 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (6 to >4.8 pts): 2–3 concise artifacts directly support key narrative claims (technical and/or team/process artifacts are acceptable).

- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (0.8 to >0 pts): Evidence not evaluable.

## Action plan: three actions and realism (8 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (8 to >6.5 pts): Exactly three actions; each is concise, realistic, and clearly addresses a pain point or reinforces a success.

- **Exceeds Expectations** (6 to >4.8 pts): Each action includes a plain-language recognition cue showing what success looks like.
- **Meets Expectations** (4.8 to >1.0 pts): Some success criteria exist but are vague.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): No meaningful success criteria.

## Individual wins/gaps: specificity to owned area (6 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (6 to >4.8 pts): 1–2 wins and 1–2 gaps are clearly tied to the student’s owned components/practices.

## Individual wins/gaps: concrete example (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): Includes at least one concrete example that supports the reflection.

## Individual wins/gaps: reflection and analysis (4 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (4 to >3.2 pts): Brief analysis of what helped or hurt performance (not just listing).
- **Meets Expectations** (3.2 to >0.8 pts): Some reflection, limited analysis.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (0.8 to >0 pts): No reflection beyond listing.

## Commitments: actionable and realistic (6 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (6 to >4.8 pts): Two commitments are realistic, actionable, and directly address the student’s gaps/role.

- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): No check-in cues.

## Commitments: observable outcomes (4 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (4 to >3.2 pts): Each commitment includes an observable outcome that would demonstrate improvement.

## Blocker: specificity and plausibility (4 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (4 to >3.2 pts): Identifies one specific, plausible blocker that could hinder the student or team.
