# Retrospective - Rubrics

## Team narrative: successes and pain points (8 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (8 to >6.5 pts): Clearly identifies top 3 successes and top 3 pain points; descriptions are specific and non-generic.
- **Meets Expectations** (6.5 to >1.5 pts): Successes/pain points are identified but some are vague or incomplete.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.5 to >0 pts): Missing or too vague to evaluate.

## Team narrative: coherence and synthesis (8 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (8 to >6.5 pts): Reads as a coherent narrative with synthesis (not a status list); shows prioritization and a clear “story of the term.”
- **Meets Expectations** (6.5 to >1.5 pts): Mostly coherent; some sections drift into status updates.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.5 to >0 pts): Primarily a status list.

## Team narrative: causal analysis (why it happened) (7 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (7 to >5.6 pts): Provides plausible causes for major successes/pain points; causes are grounded in team behavior/process.
- **Meets Expectations** (5.6 to >1.4 pts): Some causal explanation exists but is thin or partly speculative.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.4 to >0 pts): Little or no causal analysis.

## Team narrative: team-dynamics insights (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): Clear insights about team dynamics (communication, decision-making, coordination, accountability, workload balance, inclusion) tied to examples.
- **Meets Expectations** (4 to >1.0 pts): Mentions team dynamics but connections to examples are light.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): No meaningful team-dynamics reflection.

## Evidence: relevance to narrative claims (10 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (10 to >8.0 pts): At least one concise artifact directly supports key narrative claims (technical and/or team/process artifacts are acceptable) and is clearly chosen to reinforce the most important successes/pain points.
- **Meets Expectations** (8 to >2.0 pts): At least one artifact supports the narrative; relevance is partial or the selection doesn’t clearly support the most important claims.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (2.0 to >0 pts): Artifacts missing or unrelated.

## Action plan: three actions and realism (6 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (6 to >4.8 pts): At least three actions; each is concise, realistic, and clearly addresses a pain point or reinforces a success.
- **Meets Expectations** (4.8 to >1.2 pts): Actions exist but some are vague or not clearly connected to the narrative.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.2 to >0 pts): Missing actions or actions are not actionable.

## Action plan: owners and timeframes (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): Each action has a single owner and a clear timeframe.
- **Meets Expectations** (4 to >1.0 pts): Owners/timeframes present but inconsistent.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): Owners/timeframes missing.

## Action plan: recognition cues (success criteria) (9 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (9 to >7.2 pts): Each action includes a plain-language recognition cue showing what success looks like.
- **Meets Expectations** (7.2 to >1.8 pts): Some success criteria exist but are vague.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.8 to >0 pts): No meaningful success criteria.

## Individual pages: wins, gaps, and example quality (14 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (14 to >11.2 pts): 1–2 wins and 1–2 gaps are clearly tied to the student’s owned area, with at least one concrete example; includes brief analysis of what helped or hurt performance.
- **Meets Expectations** (11.2 to >2.8 pts): Wins/gaps and an example exist, but ties to owned area and/or analysis are thin.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (2.8 to >0 pts): Generic wins/gaps and/or missing concrete example; little to no analysis.

## Individual pages: improvement commitments (8 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (8 to >6.4 pts): Two commitments are realistic and actionable, each includes how progress will be checked (date/event/cue) and a clearly observable outcome.
- **Meets Expectations** (6.4 to >1.6 pts): Two commitments exist but one or more pieces are vague (action, check-in cue, or observable outcome).
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.6 to >0 pts): Fewer than two commitments, or commitments are not actionable/checkable.

## Individual pages: blocker and mitigation (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): Identifies one specific, plausible blocker and includes a clear mitigation step the student will lead, a simple trigger for when to act, and a concrete “helped” cue.
- **Meets Expectations** (4 to >1.0 pts): Blocker and mitigation exist, but specificity/trigger/helped cue are partly vague.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): Blocker is generic or missing, or mitigation/trigger/helped cue are missing.

## Writing: structure and readability (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): Concise, well-structured, polished; uses clear headings and bullets; stays close to the expected core length (team sections ~1–2 pages plus individual pages) while still being complete; screenshots/visuals enhance readability.
- **Meets Expectations** (4 to >1.0 pts): Mostly clear with some structure; minor readability issues or slightly off-target length.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): Hard to read; poorly structured.

## Writing: professionalism and clarity (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): Professional tone; narrative claims are precise and easy to follow; actions/commitments use consistent formatting and are written in checkable, verifiable language.
- **Meets Expectations** (4 to >1.0 pts): Generally clear; occasional ambiguity, inconsistent formatting, or awkward wording.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): Unclear or unprofessional tone; inconsistent or confusing writing.

## Writing: accessibility (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): Images/screenshots are legible and include alt text and short captions that explain what the evidence shows and why it matters; links use descriptive text; private links include lightweight screenshots/snippets so graders can evaluate.
- **Meets Expectations** (4 to >1.0 pts): Some accessibility practices are used; minor gaps (e.g., missing some alt text/captions, captions lack context, or vague link text).
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): Missing alt text/captions or inaccessible formatting; evidence not evaluable due to inaccessible/private links.
