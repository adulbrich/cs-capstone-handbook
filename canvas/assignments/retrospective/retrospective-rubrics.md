# Retrospective - Rubrics

## Team narrative synthesis and insights (team) (25 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (25 to >20.0 pts): Compelling, coherent narrative using 2–3 themes that clearly explain the top successes and pain points with plausible causes; integrates specific illustrative examples naturally into the story.
- **Meets Expectations** (20 to >5.0 pts): Identifies top successes and pain points; themes and causes are present but lightly developed.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (5 to >0 pts): Reads like a status list; no meaningful themes or causes.

## Evidence examples and artifacts (team) (15 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (15 to >12.0 pts): Includes 2–3 concise, relevant artifacts (e.g., PR excerpt, board snapshot, linked issue) with clear captions that directly reinforce the narrative themes.
- **Meets Expectations** (12 to >3.0 pts): Provides at least one concrete supporting artifact.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (3 to >0 pts): Assertions unsupported; no concrete evidence.

## Team action plan with owners (team) (20 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (20 to >16.0 pts): Three concise, realistic actions with clear owners and timeframes; each includes a plain-language recognition cue showing what success looks like.
- **Meets Expectations** (16 to >4.0 pts): Three actions with owners and timeframes; success criteria somewhat clear.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (4 to >0 pts): Actions vague, missing owners/timeframes, or lacking recognizable success criteria.

## Wins and gaps (individual) (15 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (15 to >12.0 pts): Thoughtful reflections tying wins/gaps to specific owned components/practices; includes at least one concrete example and brief analysis of what helped or hurt performance.
- **Meets Expectations** (12 to >3.0 pts): Lists wins and gaps with at least one concrete example.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (3 to >0 pts): Generic or missing; no example tied to the student’s domain.

## Commitments to improve (individual) (15 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (15 to >12.0 pts): Two concise, realistic commitments each with a check-in cue (date/event) and an observable outcome (e.g., 'peer signs off on tests before merge').
- **Meets Expectations** (12 to >3.0 pts): Two clear commitments with a simple method to check progress (e.g., 'pair weekly on X', 'draft tests before PR'); tied to owned area.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (3 to >0 pts): Fewer than two commitments OR commitments not actionable/measurable.

## Anticipated blocker and prevention plan (individual) (10 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (10 to >8.0 pts): Identifies one specific, plausible blocker that could hinder you or the team next term. Includes a clear prevention/mitigation step you will personally lead, a simple trigger for when to act (e.g., 'if review queue >5 PRs'), and a concrete 'helped' cue showing how you will know your action made a positive impact.
- **Meets Expectations** (8 to >2.0 pts): Identifies one likely blocker and provides a direct, actionable step you will take to prevent or reduce its impact.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (2 to >0 pts): Blocker is vague, generic, or unrelated to your work; prevention step is missing, unclear, or not actionable.
