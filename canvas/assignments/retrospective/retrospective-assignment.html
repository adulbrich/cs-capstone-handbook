<p><span style="background-color: #007bff; color: white; padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 4px; font-size: 14px;">Team Submission with Individual Contributions</span></p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Explain the term through a clear narrative of patterns, not a status list.</li>
    <li>Support claims with lightweight, concrete artifacts.</li>
    <li>Commit to realistic team-level and individual-level improvements.</li>
    <li>Strengthen shared ownership of engineering practice and team health.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What You Must Produce</h2>
<p>Submit <strong>one team retrospective</strong> (PDF, 1-2 pages plus individual pages). Individual grades depend on demonstrated reflection quality and specificity.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Filename format: <code>YYYY-MM-DD-[TeamID]-Retrospective.pdf</code></li>
    <li>Example: <code>2026-03-15-CS.042-Retrospective.pdf</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Required Report Structure</h2>
<p>Your submission must include the following sections. Each section corresponds directly to a rubric criterion.</p>
<h3>1. Team Narrative</h3>
<p>Write a synthesized story of your term (consolidated from individual write-up + discussion), not a list of events. Include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Top 3 successes</strong> and <strong>top 3 pain points</strong></li>
    <li>Grouped into <strong>2&ndash;3 themes</strong> that explain meaningful patterns</li>
    <li>Brief, plausible causes for each theme</li>
    <li>Short references to concrete examples (links or screenshots)</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Evidence Examples&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Provide lightweight artifacts that reinforce your themes (<strong>1-3 examples</strong>). Examples include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Before/after PR or code review excerpts</li>
    <li>Sprint board snapshots</li>
    <li>Issue or PR links (with 1&ndash;2 sentence captions)</li>
    <li>Small screenshot of a discussion thread (legible)</li>
</ul>
<p>If a link is private, include a small screenshot or quoted snippet so graders can evaluate it.</p>
<h3>3. Team Action Plan</h3>
<p>List <strong>exactly three</strong> team actions you will implement next term. For each action, include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Owner</strong> (single person responsible)</li>
    <li><strong>Timeframe</strong> (e.g., &ldquo;by Week 3&rdquo;, &ldquo;starting next sprint&rdquo;)</li>
    <li><strong>Plain-language recognition cue</strong> describing how you will know it&rsquo;s working<br />(e.g., &ldquo;standup handoffs &lt;5m&rdquo;, &ldquo;review turnaround usually same day&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Individual Pages</h3>
<p>Attach clearly labeled individual pages (<strong>~1 page per student</strong>). For each student, include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1&ndash;2 wins</strong> and <strong>1&ndash;2 gaps</strong> with at least <strong>one concrete example</strong> tied to your owned area.</li>
    <li><strong>Two improvement commitments</strong> that are realistic, actionable, and checkable, each including:
        <ul>
            <li>How progress will be checked (date/event/cue)</li>
            <li>The observable outcome you expect</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>One likely blocker</strong> you will personally take the lead on preventing next term. Think of this as: &ldquo;What is one thing that could block you or the team next term, and what will you personally do about it?&rdquo; For this blocker, include:
        <ul>
            <li>A clear mitigation step (what you will actually do)</li>
            <li>A simple trigger for when to act (e.g., &ldquo;if review queue &gt;5 PRs&rdquo;)</li>
            <li>A &ldquo;helped&rdquo; cue (how you will know your mitigation had impact)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Formatting Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Team sections ~1-2 pages; individual pages attached after.</li>
    <li>Use clear headings, bullets, and descriptive link text.</li>
    <li>Include alt text for images; use short captions for artifact snippets.</li>
    <li>No dashboards or analytics exports&mdash;keep evidence lightweight.</li>
    <li><strong>Generative AI may be used for writing. Do NOT fabricate artifacts or data.</strong></li>
</ul>
