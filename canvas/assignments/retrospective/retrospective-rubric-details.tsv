Team narrative: successes and pain points		false	8	Exceeds Expectations	Clearly identifies top 3 successes and top 3 pain points; descriptions are specific and non-generic.	6.5	Meets Expectations	Successes/pain points are identified but some are vague or incomplete.	1.5	Does Not Meet Expectations	Missing or too vague to evaluate.			
Team narrative: coherence and synthesis		false	8	Exceeds Expectations	Reads as a coherent narrative with synthesis (not a status list); shows prioritization and a clear “story of the term.”	6.5	Meets Expectations	Mostly coherent; some sections drift into status updates.	1.5	Does Not Meet Expectations	Primarily a status list.			
Team narrative: causal analysis (why it happened)		false	7	Exceeds Expectations	Provides plausible causes for major successes/pain points; causes are grounded in team behavior/process.	5.6	Meets Expectations	Some causal explanation exists but is thin or partly speculative.	1.4	Does Not Meet Expectations	Little or no causal analysis.			
Team narrative: team-dynamics insights		false	5	Exceeds Expectations	Clear insights about team dynamics (communication, decision-making, coordination, accountability, workload balance, inclusion) tied to examples.	4	Meets Expectations	Mentions team dynamics but connections to examples are light.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	No meaningful team-dynamics reflection.			
Evidence: relevance to narrative claims		false	10	Exceeds Expectations	At least one concise artifact directly supports key narrative claims (technical and/or team/process artifacts are acceptable) and is clearly chosen to reinforce the most important successes/pain points.	8	Meets Expectations	At least one artifact supports the narrative; relevance is partial or the selection doesn’t clearly support the most important claims.	2	Does Not Meet Expectations	Artifacts missing or unrelated.			
Action plan: three actions and realism		false	6	Exceeds Expectations	At least three actions; each is concise, realistic, and clearly addresses a pain point or reinforces a success.	4.8	Meets Expectations	Actions exist but some are vague or not clearly connected to the narrative.	1.2	Does Not Meet Expectations	Missing actions or actions are not actionable.			
Action plan: owners and timeframes		false	5	Exceeds Expectations	Each action has a single owner and a clear timeframe.	4	Meets Expectations	Owners/timeframes present but inconsistent.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Owners/timeframes missing.			
Action plan: recognition cues (success criteria)		false	9	Exceeds Expectations	Each action includes a plain-language recognition cue showing what success looks like.	7.2	Meets Expectations	Some success criteria exist but are vague.	1.8	Does Not Meet Expectations	No meaningful success criteria.			
Individual pages: wins, gaps, and example quality		false	14	Exceeds Expectations	1–2 wins and 1–2 gaps are clearly tied to the student’s owned area, with at least one concrete example; includes brief analysis of what helped or hurt performance.	11.2	Meets Expectations	Wins/gaps and an example exist, but ties to owned area and/or analysis are thin.	2.8	Does Not Meet Expectations	Generic wins/gaps and/or missing concrete example; little to no analysis.			
Individual pages: improvement commitments		false	8	Exceeds Expectations	Two commitments are realistic and actionable, each includes how progress will be checked (date/event/cue) and a clearly observable outcome.	6.4	Meets Expectations	Two commitments exist but one or more pieces are vague (action, check-in cue, or observable outcome).	1.6	Does Not Meet Expectations	Fewer than two commitments, or commitments are not actionable/checkable.			
Individual pages: blocker and mitigation		false	5	Exceeds Expectations	Identifies one specific, plausible blocker and includes a clear mitigation step the student will lead, a simple trigger for when to act, and a concrete “helped” cue.	4	Meets Expectations	Blocker and mitigation exist, but specificity/trigger/helped cue are partly vague.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Blocker is generic or missing, or mitigation/trigger/helped cue are missing.			
Writing: structure and readability		false	5	Exceeds Expectations	Concise, well-structured, polished; uses clear headings and bullets; stays close to the expected core length (team sections ~1–2 pages plus individual pages) while still being complete; screenshots/visuals enhance readability.	4	Meets Expectations	Mostly clear with some structure; minor readability issues or slightly off-target length.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Hard to read; poorly structured.			
Writing: professionalism and clarity		false	5	Exceeds Expectations	Professional tone; narrative claims are precise and easy to follow; actions/commitments use consistent formatting and are written in checkable, verifiable language.	4	Meets Expectations	Generally clear; occasional ambiguity, inconsistent formatting, or awkward wording.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Unclear or unprofessional tone; inconsistent or confusing writing.			
Writing: accessibility		false	5	Exceeds Expectations	Images/screenshots are legible and include alt text and short captions that explain what the evidence shows and why it matters; links use descriptive text; private links include lightweight screenshots/snippets so graders can evaluate.	4	Meets Expectations	Some accessibility practices are used; minor gaps (e.g., missing some alt text/captions, captions lack context, or vague link text).	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Missing alt text/captions or inaccessible formatting; evidence not evaluable due to inaccessible/private links.
