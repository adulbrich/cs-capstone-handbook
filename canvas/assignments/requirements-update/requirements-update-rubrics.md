# Requirements Update - Rubrics

## Change Log Quality and Traceability (15 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (15 to >12.0 pts): Clear, high-level entries documenting each revision with date, version/tag, sections changed, concise edit summary, rationale/drivers, and named authors/subteam.
- **Meets Expectations** (12 to >3.0 pts): Basic entries that include date, sections changed, brief rationale, and minimal author detail.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (3 to >0 pts): Missing or unclear change log; no authors; entries too vague.

## Problem Statement and Scope (15 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (15 to >12.0 pts): Clear problem statement with primary/secondary users, context of use, system boundaries, ≥2 measurable success criteria, and ≥1 explicit non-goal.
- **Meets Expectations** (12 to >3.0 pts): Includes users and context with at least one measurable success criterion or non-goal; some elements may be unclear.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (3 to >0 pts): Missing key elements or not updated; success criteria vague or not measurable.

## Requirements Quality, Structure and Updates (35 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (35 to >28.0 pts): Requirements are atomic, testable, unambiguous with unique IDs; clear prioritization; high-priority items include ACs (Given/When/Then); NFRs present; dependencies and PR/issue links included.
- **Meets Expectations** (28 to >7.0 pts): Mostly atomic/testable requirements with IDs; some ACs or NFRs missing or underdeveloped; links/status present for many items.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (7 to >0 pts): Many vague/compound requirements, missing IDs/ACs/NFRs; little or no links or implementation status.

## Product and Stakeholder Risks (20 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (20 to >16.0 pts): Key product/stakeholder risks identified with impact/likelihood/mitigation; mappings to affected requirements are clear and accurate.
- **Meets Expectations** (16 to >4.0 pts): Several relevant risks identified with basic impact/likelihood/mitigation; mapping to requirements may be incomplete.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (4 to >0 pts): Risk list superficial, missing important risks, or lacks meaningful mapping.

## Formatting, Clarity and Professionalism (15 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (15 to >12.0 pts): Clean, concise, well-structured (2–4 pages), consistently formatted, professional language; requirements follow a uniform style and evidence links are clear.
- **Meets Expectations** (12 to >3.0 pts): Mostly clear and readable; some formatting or consistency issues; minor ambiguity in wording.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (3 to >0 pts): Hard to read, inconsistent structure, missing sections, or unclear requirement wording.
