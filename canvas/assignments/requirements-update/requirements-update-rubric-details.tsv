Requirements: NFRs and constraints		true	6	Exceeds Expectations	Non-functional requirements/constraints are present and written in a testable way where possible.	4.8	Meets Expectations	NFRs exist but are underdeveloped.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	NFRs missing.			
Requirements: dependencies, status, and links		true	6	Exceeds Expectations	Dependencies are noted; implementation status is current; links to PRs/issues/artifacts are included where relevant.	4.8	Meets Expectations	Some dependencies/status/links/artifacts are present but incomplete.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Little or no traceability or status.
