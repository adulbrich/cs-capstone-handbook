    <p>This is the first low-stakes peer-review evaluation worth 25 points. You have the exact same survey to complete at the end of the term, worth 100 points. Please use this assignment's grade to course-correct, if needed. Consider reading <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://capstone.alexulbrich.com/activities/conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict resolution activities</a>. <strong>This assignment is only 5% of your grade and you cannot earn less than half credit (minimum 12.5/25).</strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure individual accountability and fairness in team grading.</li>
    <li>Practice giving specific, professional feedback to peers.</li>
    <li>Reflect on effective team behaviors you want to repeat (or avoid) in future projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What You Must Produce</h2>
<p>Complete the Qualtrics survey sent to your OSU email inbox. There is nothing to submit in Canvas.</p>

<p>Refer to the handbook for <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://capstone.alexulbrich.com/project-evaluation/peer-evaluations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more information on the criteria and grade calculation</a>.</p>
<p>The survey is open for a limited time only. A failure to submit by the due date will result in 12.5/25.</p>

<p>If you have questions about your grade after results are processed, <strong>contact the instructors directly</strong>. Your responses are <strong>anonymous to peers</strong> and shared with <strong>instructors only</strong>. TAs might be made aware of certain dynamics.</p>

<h2>Survey Structure</h2>

<h3>Roster Confirmation</h3>
<p>Open the Qualtrics link sent to your ONID email and confirm your team roster in the survey. We use ONID usernames (e.g., <code>ulbrical@oregonstate.edu</code>) instead of first and last names.</p>

<h3>Criteria Ratings</h3>
<p>Rate each teammate (including yourself) on the different criteria.</p>

<h3>100-Point Allocation</h3>
<p>Distribute 100 points across all team members (including yourself).</p>

<ul>
    <li>The total must equal <strong>100</strong>.</li>
    <li>You must assign yourself <strong>at least 100/N</strong> points (N = team size).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Qualitative Comments</h3>
<p>Optional but strongly encouraged: add comments supporting unusually high or low allocations and noting specific helpful or harmful behaviors.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ratings reflect <strong>observed behaviors and artifacts</strong> (tasks completed, PRs reviewed/merged, meeting reliability), not popularity.</li>
    <li>The 100-point split is <strong>honest and justified</strong>, not uniform by default nor punitive without evidence.</li>
    <li>Comments (when provided) include <strong>specific examples</strong> (e.g., &ldquo;closed 7 issues on API auth; fixed flaky tests; led sprint demo&rdquo;) or <strong>specific gaps</strong> (e.g., &ldquo;missed 3 standups; 2 PRs required major rework due to failing tests&rdquo;).</li>
    <li>Tone remains <strong>professional and constructive</strong>; focuses on work and impact.</li>
    <li>All team members (including self) are <strong>rated on all criteria</strong>, and totals are <strong>valid</strong> (sum = 100; self &ge; 100/N).</li>
    <li><strong>Generative AI may be used for writing.</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> fabricate artifacts, evidence, or data; all examples and claims must be real.</li>
</ul>
