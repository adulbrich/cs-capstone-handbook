<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Practice making an explicit, defensible engineering decision using an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).</li>
    <li>Demonstrate rigorous code review that checks correctness, design, tests, and security&mdash;not just style nits.</li>
    <li>Show professional communication and follow-through by tying feedback to concrete changes.</li>
    <li>Build a durable team artifact that documents why a choice was made and how quality improved.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><strong>Deliverable, Audience and Genre:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ADR:</strong> Individually write an internal technical memo for your project team and future maintainers.</li>
    <li><strong>Code review:</strong> Complete and summarize a code review aimed at the PR author and maintainers; the feedback should be objective, specific, and constructive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Allowed Resources:</strong> Your team repo and review system for gathering materials, your ADR template; project style guides; official framework/security docs, linting, test runners, static analysis, <span>and&nbsp;</span><span>Generative AI tools for reserach, editing, organization, and phrasing</span><span>. Do not fabricate evidence (e.g., benchmarks).</span></p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Select a design choice</strong> you influenced this term (e.g., library/API selection, data model change, build/deploy strategy).</li>
    <li><strong>Author an ADR</strong> using your team&rsquo;s template that includes: context, decision drivers, at least two viable options plus the &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; baseline, rationale/tradeoffs, decision, and consequences. Cite benchmarks/docs as relevant.</li>
    <li><strong>Collect evidence</strong> (tests, measurements, docs) that informed your decision and embed it in your ADR or an appendix.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose an active or recently merged PR</strong> from your project that you did not author.</li>
    <li><strong>Conduct a substantive code review</strong>: check correctness, design/architecture, test impact/coverage, and security considerations. Provide actionable comments with examples or links to standards (not to your repo).</li>
    <li><strong>Capture the review</strong> by exporting your comments and relevant snippets into a self-contained document with screenshots as needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Demonstrate adoption/follow-through</strong> by capturing evidence of updates that resulted from your review or ADR (diffs, added tests, author replies).</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble your submission package</strong> (see Deliverables). All evidence must be <strong>self-contained</strong> in files you upload to Canvas, no repository links required.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Quality Checklist</h2>
<ul>
    <li>ADR includes context, decision drivers, viable options (including &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;), decision, tradeoffs, and consequences; evidence is embedded (snippets, screenshots, measurements) and references to standards/docs are cited.</li>
    <li>Consequences are concrete and discuss impact on complexity, performance, testing, security, and operations.</li>
    <li>Code review provides actionable guidance with examples/diffs and covers correctness, design/architecture, tests/coverage, and security; links point to standards/docs (not to your repo).</li>
    <li>Professional, respectful tone throughout.</li>
    <li>Visible follow-through: updated code/tests or a documented explanation when suggestions weren&rsquo;t adopted.</li>
    <li>Submission is self-contained so a grader can verify everything without accessing your repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the Canvas rubric for detailed performance levels.</p>
<h2>Reflection (optional, ~5&ndash;8 min)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What tradeoff became clearer only after you wrote the ADR, and what metric would you gather next time?</li>
    <li>Which type of review comment most effectively led to change, and how will you use that pattern going forward?</li>
</ul>
