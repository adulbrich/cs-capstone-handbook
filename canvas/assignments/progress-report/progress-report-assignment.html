<p><span style="background-color: #007bff; color: white; padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 4px; font-size: 14px;">Team Submission with Individual Contributions</span></p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Report measurable, verifiable sprint progress rather than intentions.</li>
    <li>Demonstrate traceability between requirements &rarr; tasks &rarr; PRs/issues &rarr; (deployable) software.</li>
    <li>Maintain consistent risk and quality tracking across sprints.</li>
    <li>Practice concise, professional technical communication.</li>
    <li>Strengthen accountability through transparent documentation of individual contributions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What You Must Produce</h2>
<p>Submit <strong>one team progress report</strong> (PDF, 1-2 pages). Individual grades depend on demonstrated contributions. There is a separate assignment for graders to deduct points at the individual level. By default, you will get max points on that assignment.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Filename format: <code>YYYY-MM-DD-[TeamID]-Sprint6-ProgressReport.pdf</code></li>
    <li>Example: <code>2026-01-18-CS.042-Sprint6-ProgressReport.pdf</code></li>
    <li>Template: TBD</li>
</ul>
<h2>Required Report Structure</h2>
<p>Your submission must include the following sections. Each section aligns to one or more rubric criteria.</p>
<h3>1. Summary</h3>
<p>A concise overview of the sprint: major outcomes, blockers, and key insights (<strong>3-5 bullets</strong>).</p>
<h3>2. Sprint Work Log (Work Items + Evidence + Attribution)</h3>
<p>List the work items you completed or meaningfully worked on during the sprint. A <strong>list format</strong> is preferred over a table (tables can become hard to read with many items).</p>
<p>Each item must be <strong>measurable</strong> and include <strong>evidence</strong> and <strong>attribution</strong>. Items can be requirements work, bug fixes, infrastructure work, stakeholder/marketing/outreach tasks, research/spikes, documentation, etc.</p>
<p><strong>For each work item, include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Title</strong> (short, specific)</li>
    <li><strong>Status</strong> (done / partial / not done) or a clear %</li>
    <li><strong>Owner / Author</strong> (who did the primary work)</li>
    <li><strong>Reviewer(s) / Collaborator(s)</strong> (if applicable)</li>
    <li><strong>Source link</strong> (issue, task, PR, sprint plan item, requirement, test, ADR, or doumentation, i.e., something trackable)</li>
    <li><strong>Supporting artifact</strong> (at least one verifiable artifact)
        <ul>
            <li>Deploy URL, screenshots, demo clip</li>
            <li>CI/build status or brief test summary</li>
            <li>Write-up artifacts (ADR, design doc, spike results, interview summary, decision log)</li>
            <li>Diagrams/specifications</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Notes</strong> (optional): blockers, plan changes, or what remains</li>
</ul>
<p><em>One artifact may cover multiple work items</em> (e.g., one demo clip shows several features), as long as you clearly say which items it covers.</p>
<p>If an artifact corresponds to a code state, include the relevant commit hash(es). If an artifact is a write-up, include a stable link and enough context to evaluate it (title/date/version/location).</p>
<h3>3. Risk and Quality Tracking</h3>
<p>List the number of recorded bugs currently open and the highest-impact open bugs.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bug count (1 line):</strong> Open bugs now = <strong>[N]</strong>. Include a link to your bug list / issue query.</li>
    <li><strong>Top bugs (3&ndash;5 items):</strong> list your highest-impact open bugs.</li>
    <li><strong>Each bug must include:</strong> severity/impact, owner, current status, and a link.</li>
    <li><strong>Actions:</strong> assign a concrete next step for the top 2&ndash;3 bugs (who does what by when).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you truly have no bugs:</strong> write <strong>&ldquo;No known bugs&rdquo;</strong> and link to where you track issues, plus 1 sentence describing what you did to check (e.g., manual test pass, demo run-through, CI green).</p>

<h3>4. Next Sprint Plan</h3>
<p>List the most important next sprint work items (<strong>3-5 items</strong>). These do <strong>not</strong> have to be requirements&mdash;they can be bug fixes, infrastructure work, stakeholder/marketing/outreach tasks, research/spikes, documentation, or anything else that produces a measurable outcome.</p>
<p>Each item must include a link to a verifiable source of truth, such as a requirement ID, test ID, GitHub issue/task, ADR/design doc, marketing plan doc, or other trackable artifact. This supports traceability and makes planning gradeable.</p>
<h3>5. Team Process Reflection</h3>
<p>Write <strong>3-5 sentences</strong> reflecting on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What worked</li>
    <li>What didn&rsquo;t</li>
    <li>One or two actionable improvements</li>
    <li>What evidence will show the improvements worked</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formatting Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Keep the main body around 1-2 pages, with screenshots/clips linked or appended.</li>
    <li>Use clear headings, bullets, and descriptive link text.</li>
    <li>All images require alt text.</li>
    <li>Do not attach binaries; use links to repo/CI/deploy.</li>
    <li><strong>Generative AI may be used for writing. Do NOT fabricate artifacts or data.</strong></li>
</ul>
