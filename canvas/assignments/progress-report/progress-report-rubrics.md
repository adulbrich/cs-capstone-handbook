# Progress Report - Rubrics

## Summary: outcomes, blockers, and insights (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): 3-5 concise bullets that clearly state sprint outcomes, notable blockers, and key insights; claims are consistent with the detailed work log/evidence.
- **Meets Expectations** (4 to >1.0 pts): Summary present and mostly clear, but missing either outcomes, blockers, or insights, and/or contains a few vague/unsupported claims.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): Summary is missing, unclear, or primarily aspirational (intentions) instead of reporting measurable outcomes.

## Sprint work log: quantification and goal linkage (8 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (8 to >6.5 pts): Work items are clearly quantified (e.g., %/done/partial) and tied to the sprint goals/commitments.
- **Meets Expectations** (6.5 to >1.5 pts): Progress is described and partially quantified; linkage to sprint goals/commitments is present but incomplete.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.5 to >0 pts): Progress is vague and not connected to sprint goals/commitments.

## Sprint work log: title, status, and author (4 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (4 to >3.2 pts): Each major work item has a clear title, an unambiguous status (%/done/partial), and a clear owner/author.
- **Meets Expectations** (3.2 to >0.8 pts): Most items include title/status/owner, but coverage is inconsistent or status is sometimes vague.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (0.8 to >0 pts): Many items are missing title/status/owner, or status is unclear.

## Sprint work log: reviewers and source link (3 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (3 to >2.4 pts): Each major work item includes a trackable source link (issue/task/PR/requirement/test/ADR/doc) and reviewers/collaborators are listed where applicable.
- **Meets Expectations** (2.4 to >0.6 pts): Many items include links and/or reviewers, but coverage is incomplete or inconsistently formatted.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (0.6 to >0 pts): Few or no links and/or reviewers/collaborators.

## Sprint work log: blockers and replans (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): Blockers are documented with concrete replans (what changed, why, and what will be done next).
- **Meets Expectations** (4 to >1.0 pts): Blockers are mentioned with a basic response.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): Blockers/replans are missing or unclear.

## Sprint work log: supporting artifacts (per-item evidence coverage) (12 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (12 to >9.5 pts): Each work item in the sprint work log has at least one verifiable supporting artifact, or one artifact clearly covers multiple items (explicitly stated).
- **Meets Expectations** (9.5 to >2.5 pts): Many items have supporting artifacts, but coverage is incomplete or doesn’t clearly map to the listed items.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (2.5 to >0 pts): Few or no items have verifiable supporting artifacts.

## Sprint work log: supporting artifacts (relevance and context) (7 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (7 to >5.5 pts): Artifacts are clearly relevant to claims and include brief context (what it shows and why it matters).
- **Meets Expectations** (5.5 to >1.0 pts): Artifacts are mostly relevant but context/captions are inconsistent.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): Artifacts are unclear, unlabeled, or not clearly tied to the claims.

## Sprint work log: supporting artifacts (traceability and “version of truth”) (6 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (6 to >4.8 pts): Artifacts link to an evaluable source of truth. For code-related artifacts, commit hash(es) are included; for write-ups, a stable link plus title/date/version/location is included.
- **Meets Expectations** (4.8 to >1.0 pts): Some traceability details are present, but hashes/links/context are incomplete.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): Artifacts aren’t traceable (no hashes where applicable, broken links, or missing context).

## Bug tracking: bug snapshot is current (8 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (8 to >6.5 pts): Includes the current open bug count (with a link to the bug list/query) and a prioritized list of the top 3-5 highest-impact open bugs. If claiming "No known bugs", includes a link to where issues are tracked and a brief note on what was done to check.
- **Meets Expectations** (6.5 to >1.5 pts): Includes some bug information, but it is missing either the count, the top-bug list, or is not clearly current.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.5 to >0 pts): No meaningful bug snapshot is provided.

## Bug tracking: per-bug details, traceability, and actions (12 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (12 to >9.5 pts): For each listed top bug, includes severity/impact, owner, current status, and a usable link to the source of truth. The top 2-3 bugs also include a concrete next action (who does what by when).
- **Meets Expectations** (9.5 to >2.5 pts): Most bugs include some details/links, but coverage is inconsistent (e.g., missing owner/status/severity), links are hard to evaluate, and/or actions are vague.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (2.5 to >0 pts): Bug list lacks key fields (owner/status/severity) and/or has few or no usable links/actions.

## Next sprint plan: prioritized and traceable (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): 3–5 clear next-sprint items are prioritized, measurable, and each links to a verifiable source of truth (issue/task/requirement/test/ADR/doc).
- **Meets Expectations** (4 to >1.0 pts): Next-sprint items are listed with some prioritization and some links, but specificity/traceability is uneven.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): Next-sprint plan is missing, vague, or lacks links.

## Team process reflection: specificity and insight (7 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (7 to >5.5 pts): Reflection is specific and grounded in what happened; identifies the “why,” not just the “what.”

- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): No meaningful reflection.

## Team process reflection: actionable improvements (5 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (5 to >4.0 pts): 1–2 concrete, actionable improvements with clear next steps.
- **Meets Expectations** (4 to >1.0 pts): Improvements listed but may be vague.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (1.0 to >0 pts): No actionable improvements.

## Team process reflection: next-sprint application (3 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (3 to >2.4 pts): Shows how the team will apply improvements next sprint (e.g., who/when/how tracked).
- **Meets Expectations** (2.4 to >0.5 pts): Intends to apply improvements but plan is light.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (0.5 to >0 pts): No plan to apply improvements.

## Writing: structure and readability (4 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (4 to >3.2 pts): Concise, well-structured, polished; uses clear headings and bullets; optional images/media (if included) are legible and improve readability.
