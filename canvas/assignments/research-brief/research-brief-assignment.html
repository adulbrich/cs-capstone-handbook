<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Build a quick, accurate understanding of a narrow domain/tech/market slice relevant to your project.</li>
    <li>Practice finding and judging credible sources, separating fact from opinion.</li>
    <li>Synthesize what you learned into concrete implications your team can act on.</li>
    <li>Communicate clearly to mixed technical/non-technical teammates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><strong>Deliverable, Audience and Genre</strong>: One-page research brief for your capstone teammates and instructor; assume a mixed audience (technical + stakeholder).</p>
<p><strong>Allowed Resources</strong>: University library databases, Google Scholar, standards bodies, reputable industry research, official vendor docs, your own exploratory measurements,&nbsp;and<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Generative AI tools for idea generation, editing, organization, and phrasing</span>. Do not fabricate evidence (e.g., hallucinated sources).</p>
<p>Check the handbook's <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://capstone.alexulbrich.com/activities/requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Requirements activities</a> if you need a starting point (e.g., fill in the lean canvas and back your claims with data, research, or testing). Each team member could focus on a different activity/slice of the project.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Pick a focused slice tightly tied to your project (e.g., a library/framework decision, a regulatory constraint, a user segment, or a competitor pattern). State the slice in one sentence at the top.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Find <strong>3&ndash;5 credible sources</strong> (e.g., peer-reviewed papers, reputable industry reports, vendor docs with known authorship, standards bodies, government data, benchmarks).</li>
    <li>Read and <strong>distinguish facts from claims/opinions</strong>; note where numbers come from.</li>
    <li><strong>Synthesize</strong> the key takeaways (not a list of summaries). Convert them into <strong>2&ndash;3 concrete implications</strong> for your team&rsquo;s approach (design, risks, scope, tooling, metrics, or next experiment).</li>
    <li>Draft the brief with clear headings; explain terms and acronyms on first use; use one small visual/table only if it clarifies.</li>
    <li>Add an accessible <strong>reference list with working links</strong> (any consistent citation style).</li>
    <li>Do a quick peer pass using the prompts in <em>Self-Check</em> before submitting.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Deliverables and Format</h2>
<p>Submit your <strong>Research Brief (one page; markdown or PDF)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Filename: </em><code>YYYY-MM-DD-[ONID]-ResearchBrief.pdf/md</code> (e.g., <code>2025-09-23-ulbrical-ResearchBrief.pdf</code>)</li>
    <li><em>Contents (suggested structure):</em>
        <ul>
            <li>Updated Project Description or Problem Statement (2&ndash;4 sentences)</li>
            <li>Slice &amp; Why it Matters (1&ndash;2 sentences)</li>
            <li>Key Findings (synthesized)</li>
            <li>Implications for Our Team (2&ndash;3 bullets)</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence &amp; References (second page)</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Evidence to include (place on a seperate page):</em><br />
        <ul>
            <li>citations/links;</li>
            <li>glossary;</li>
            <li>brief quotes or data points with source;</li>
            <li>(optional) one labeled figure/table.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Formatting note:</strong> The research brief is strictly <strong>one page</strong>. Include <strong>all evidence and references on a separate second page</strong> within the same file.</p>
<p>Define acronyms; label any figure/table; keep visuals accessible (alt text or caption).</p>
<h2>Quality Checlist</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Is the topic narrow and clearly tied to the project scope?</li>
    <li>Do I have <strong>3&ndash;5 credible, traceable sources</strong> with working links?</li>
    <li>Did I <strong>separate facts from claims/opinions</strong> and cite where numbers come from?</li>
    <li>Does the writing <strong>synthesize</strong> across sources (not a list of summaries)?</li>
    <li>Are there <strong>2&ndash;3 specific, actionable implications</strong> for our team?</li>
    <li>Is content accurate and relevant; are technical terms explained; is organization clean and skimmable?</li>
    <li>If I used a visual, is it necessary, readable, accessible, and labeled?</li>
    <li>Is anything inaccurate, outdated, or off-scope? (Fix or flag limits.)</li>
    <li>What is the clearest <em>action</em> the team should take from this brief, and what&rsquo;s missing to justify it?</li>
    <li>Which statement most needs a citation or source quality upgrade?</li>
    <li>Where could synthesis replace summary? Propose the synthesis.</li>
    <li>Identify any jargon or ambiguous term and propose a plain-language alternative.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the Canvas rubric for detailed performance levels.</p>
<h2>Reflection (optional, ~5&ndash;8 min)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What changed in my team&rsquo;s plan because of this brief? What quick test or conversation should we run next?</li>
    <li>Which source types were most useful for this domain, and where should we look next time?</li>
</ul>
