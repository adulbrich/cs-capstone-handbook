# Team Charter - Rubrics
<!-- TODO: break down rubrics further to simplify grading and make them more clear cut, i.e., it should be very simple for the grader to know if the student exceeded/met/did not meet expectations without "compiling" every item in the rubric description -->

## Roles, Decisions, & Risk Management (20 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (20 to >16.0 pts): Roles and decision-making models are explicit and unambiguous. Key risks are identified with clear escalation paths. The document is sufficient for a new member to understand team operations without asking questions.
- **Meets Expectations** (16 to >4.0 pts): Defines roles, decisions, and risks with enough detail to run the team. Minor gaps in clarity or completeness.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (4 to >0 pts): Missing key elements (e.g., no decision model, vague roles). Cannot guide team operations effectively.

## Conflict Resolution & Accountability (20 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (20 to >16.0 pts): Conflict plan is restorative, time-bound, and includes measurable triggers. Accountability is explicitly tied to observable evidence (e.g., PRs, reviews, attendance logs) rather than vague promises.
- **Meets Expectations** (16 to >4.0 pts): Conflict plan is present with clear steps and escalation path. Accountability is described at a high level but may lack specific evidence ties.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (4 to >0 pts): No clear conflict plan or accountability measures. Steps are punitive, unclear, or rely solely on "trying harder."

## Definition of Done & Contribution Guidelines (20 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (20 to >16.0 pts): DoD includes specific checks for tests, code review, security/static analysis, and documentation. Evidence (links/logs) proves enforcement. `CONTRIBUTING.md` is comprehensive, referencing the DoD and including local commands for CI/linting.
- **Meets Expectations** (16 to >4.0 pts): DoD lists tests and review requirements. Basic CI gates are referenced. `CONTRIBUTING.md` exists but may lack detail.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (4 to >0 pts): DoD is absent or generic. `CONTRIBUTING.md` is missing or empty.

## Communication, Accessibility & Inclusion (15 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (15 to >12.0 pts): Meeting cadence and tools are clear. Meeting norms explicitly accommodate time zones, accessibility needs, and inclusive turn-taking. Clear process for requesting accommodations.
- **Meets Expectations** (12 to >3.0 pts): States meeting times/tools. States inclusive meeting norms and general openness to accommodations.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (3 to >0 pts): No evidence of inclusive practices or meeting structure. Potential barriers are unaddressed.

## Change Log & Professional Writing (15 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (15 to >12.0 pts): Change log is present and follows the required format. Document is well-structured with clear headings, actionable bullets, and an owner + review date on each policy. Links are functional.
- **Meets Expectations** (12 to >3.0 pts): Change log is present. Readable document with headings. Most policies have owners/dates. Minor formatting issues.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (3 to >0 pts): Change log missing. Hard to follow, unstructured, or missing owners/dates.

## Individual Contribution (10 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (10 to >8.0 pts): Clear, verifiable evidence of meaningful contribution (PRs, meeting records, etc.) provided in the submission notes.
- **Meets Expectations** (8 to >2.0 pts): Evidence of contribution is present but may be minor or less detailed.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (2 to >0 pts): No evidence of individual contribution provided.
