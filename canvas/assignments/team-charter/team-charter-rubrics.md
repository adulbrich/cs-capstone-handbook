# Team Charter - Rubrics

## Clarity & Completeness of Roles/Processes (25 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (25 to >20.0 pts): Roles, decision rules, cadence, and tools are explicit, unambiguous, and cover all phases. Risks and escalation paths are clearly defined. The document is sufficient for a new member to understand team operations without asking questions.
- **Meets Expectations** (20 to >5.0 pts): Defines roles, decisions, cadence, and tools with enough detail to run the team. Includes basic risk management and escalation. Minor gaps in clarity or completeness.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (5 to >0 pts): Missing key elements (e.g., no decision model, vague roles). Cannot guide team operations effectively.

## Conflict Resolution & Accountability (20 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (20 to >16.0 pts): Conflict plan is restorative, time-bound, and includes measurable triggers. Accountability is explicitly tied to observable evidence (e.g., PRs, reviews, attendance logs) rather than vague promises.
- **Meets Expectations** (16 to >4.0 pts): Conflict plan is present with clear steps and escalation path. Accountability is described at a high level but may lack specific evidence ties.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (4 to >0 pts): No clear conflict plan or accountability measures. Steps are punitive, unclear, or rely solely on "trying harder."

## Definition of Done & Quality Gates (20 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (20 to >16.0 pts): DoD includes specific checks for tests, code review, security/static analysis, and documentation. Named CI gates are referenced and exist in the repo. Evidence (links/logs) proves enforcement.
- **Meets Expectations** (16 to >4.0 pts): DoD lists tests and review requirements. Basic CI gates are referenced. Some evidence of enforcement is provided.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (4 to >0 pts): DoD is absent, generic, or only output-focused. No quality gates or CI integration mentioned.

## Accessibility & Inclusivity Practices (15 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (15 to >12.0 pts): Meeting norms explicitly accommodate time zones, accessibility needs, and inclusive turn-taking. Clear process for requesting accommodations. Potential barriers are anticipated and addressed.
- **Meets Expectations** (12 to >3.0 pts): States inclusive meeting norms and general openness to accommodations. Addresses basic accessibility needs.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (3 to >0 pts): No evidence of inclusive practices. Potential barriers are unaddressed or ignored.

## Professional Writing & Organization (10 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (10 to >8.0 pts): Well-structured document with clear headings, actionable bullets, and an owner + review date on each policy. Easy to navigate and scan. Links are functional and accessible.
- **Meets Expectations** (8 to >2.0 pts): Readable document with headings and action items. Most policies have owners/dates. Minor formatting issues.
- **Does Not Meet Expectations** (2 to >0 pts): Hard to follow, unstructured, or missing owners/dates. Links are broken or inaccessible.

## Individual Contribution (10 pts)

- **Exceeds Expectations** (10 to >8.0 pts): Clear, verifiable evidence of meaningful contribution (PRs, meeting records, etc.) provided in the submission notes.
- **Meets Expectations** (8 to >2.0 pts): Evidence of contribution is present but may be minor or less detailed.
