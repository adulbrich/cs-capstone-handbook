<div style="background-color: #d3d3d3; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px 15px; margin: 10px 0px;" role="note">
    <p>As part of the CS Capstone sequence (CS 461, 462, 463), your team will submit a team charter and working agreement, and contribution guidelines. This document should be updated continuously. We will collect the document once every term. <span>The charter will develop a sense of shared responsibility, increase one's own awareness, empower the team to lead according to agreements, and enhance the quality of the team process.</span></p>
    <p><span>Note that you might <strong>not have</strong> all the answers for your <strong>first submission</strong>. <strong>That is OK.&nbsp;</strong>Note the limitations or constraints and update them as you acquire additional information.</span></p>

    <p>This is a <strong>group submission</strong> that results in <strong>individual grades</strong>. Each team member must demonstrate specific, measurable contributions to receive credit. TAs and instructors reserve the right to dock up to 30 points for students who did not contribute meaningfully to assignment. Here are some concrete ways/artifacts to show individual contributions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PRs/Commits/Diffs (not only of documents but of supporting elements, boilerplate, ...)</li>
        <li>Decision/Meeting Records with Attribution</li>
        <li>Activity Reports with Attribution</li>
        <li>Changelog Entries for the Doc</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each team member must include at least <strong data-start="2789" data-end="2796">one</strong> verifiable artifact in the submission notes.</p>
</div>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Align team expectations early so you can move fast without stepping on each other.</li>
    <li>Practice professional communication and ethical team norms you&rsquo;ll use in industry.</li>
    <li>Define quality bars (Definition of Done) that keep your code shippable.</li>
    <li>Document inclusive practices so everyone can contribute effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><strong>Deliverable, Audience and Genre</strong>: Create a professional team policy document to be stored in your project repository.</p>
<p><strong>Allowed Resources</strong>: Your repo, issue tracker, CI, linter/formatter, calendars/meeting tools, and <span>Generative AI tools for idea generation, editing, organization, and phrasing</span>. Do not fabricate evidence (e.g., CI logs).</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Define how you&rsquo;ll work.</strong> Specify roles (including leadership/rotation), decision model (e.g., consent/majority/unanimity), meeting cadence, core tools, risks, and an escalation path.</li>
    <li><strong>Establish conflict resolution &amp; accountability.</strong> Write a restorative, stepwise plan with triggers, timelines, and how you&rsquo;ll use evidence (PRs, reviews, attendance) to hold each other accountable.</li>
    <li><strong>Set your Definition of Done (DoD) &amp; quality gates.</strong> List required checks: tests, code review, security/lint/static analysis, docs updates, and CI gates. Reference the exact CI/lint configs you&rsquo;ll use.</li>
    <li><strong>Commit to accessibility &amp; inclusion.</strong> Describe meeting norms (time zones, note-taking, turn-taking), how to request accommodations, and how you&rsquo;ll surface and address barriers.</li>
    <li><strong>Package it professionally.</strong> Use clear headings, actionable bullets, and add an owner and &ldquo;review-by&rdquo; date to each policy. Link to your meeting agenda/notes template.</li>
    <li><strong>Publish &amp; submit.</strong> Add files to the repo (see deliverables), ensure links work, then submit <strong>via Canvas</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Deliverables and Format</h2>
<p>Submit</p>
<ul>
    <li>the team charter and working agreement (markdown or PDF), and</li>
    <li>the contribution guidelines (markdown).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Show evidence of individual contributions to both documents</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The contribution guidelines are a document and is different from showing individual contributions.</em></p>

<p>Contribution Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
    <li>reference your DoD</li>
    <li>review expectations</li>
    <li>CI/lint commands</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence links in the charter to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>CI configuration (e.g., workflow file) and a public link to a successful run log (or a screenshot if the repo is private)</li>
    <li>Linter/formatter config committed to the repo</li>
    <li>Where tests live and how they&rsquo;re run</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence of individual contributions for all team members, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>PRs/Commits/Diffs (not only of documents but of supporting elements, boilerplate, ...)</li>
    <li>Decision/Meeting Records with Attribution</li>
    <li>Activity Reports with Attribution</li>
    <li>Changelog Entries for the Doc</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conventions and Packaging</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use consistent headings, list actionable steps, assign an owner and next review date per section.</li>
    <li>Keep links relative where possible; ensure public visibility for graders if using shared docs.</li>
    <li>Keep the charter concise (aim for ~2&ndash;4 pages of focused, scannable content).</li>
    <li>File names:<span>&nbsp;</span><code>YYYY-MM-DD-[TeamID]-TeamCharter.pdf/md</code><span>&nbsp;</span>(e.g.,<span>&nbsp;</span><code>2025-10-04-CS.001-TeamCharter.pdf/md</code>) and <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> for the contribution guidelines.</li>
    <li><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> should live in your repo and be submitted to this assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Good Looks Like</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Roles, decisions, cadence, tools, risks, and escalation are explicit enough for anyone to run a sprint without asking you questions.</li>
    <li>Conflict plan is restorative, time-bound, and tied to observable evidence (PRs, reviews, attendance), not vague promises.</li>
    <li>DoD includes tests, code review, security/static checks, documentation updates, and named CI gates you actually configured.</li>
    <li>Meeting norms are inclusive and note how to handle time zones and accommodations; barriers are anticipated proactively.</li>
    <li>The document is easy to navigate with clear headings, actionable bullets, and owner + review date on each policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the Canvas rubric for detailed performance levels.</p>
<h2>Self-Check (brief)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Are our <strong>roles</strong>, decision <strong>rules</strong>, <strong>cadence</strong>, <strong>tools</strong>, and <strong>escalation</strong> path unambiguous and complete?</li>
    <li>Does our conflict plan specify triggers, steps, and timelines, and <strong>tie accountability to evidence</strong>?</li>
    <li>Does our DoD list tests, review, security/static checks, documentation, and named CI gates that exist in the repo?</li>
    <li>Did we include accessibility and inclusion norms, and how to request accommodations?</li>
    <li>Does every policy have an owner and a review-by date? Are all links working?</li>
    <li>What part of this charter would you rely on tomorrow to make a decision without the team lead? Is it sufficiently clear?</li>
    <li>Point to one DoD item and show where it&rsquo;s enforced (file path, CI log). If you can&rsquo;t, what edit would fix it?</li>
    <li>Identify one inclusion practice that is concrete and one that is vague; suggest a rewrite to make the vague one actionable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reflection (optional, ~5&ndash;8 min)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What is one risk your team surfaced by writing this charter, and what early mitigation will you try?</li>
    <li>Which inclusion norm will you pilot in the next two meetings, and how will you know it helped?</li>
</ul>
