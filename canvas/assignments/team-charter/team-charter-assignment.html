<div style="background-color: #d3d3d3; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px 15px; margin: 10px 0px;" role="note">
    <p>As part of the CS Capstone sequence (CS 461, 462, 463), your team will submit a team charter and working agreement, and contribution guidelines. This document should be updated continuously. We will collect the document once every term. <span>The charter will develop a sense of shared responsibility, increase one's own awareness, empower the team to lead according to agreements, and enhance the quality of the team process.</span></p>
    <p><span>Note that you might <strong>not have</strong> all the answers for your <strong>first submission</strong>. <strong>That is OK.&nbsp;</strong>Note the limitations or constraints and update them as you acquire additional information.</span></p>

    <p>This is a <strong>group submission</strong> that results in <strong>individual grades</strong>. Each team member must demonstrate specific, measurable contributions to receive credit. TAs and instructors reserve the right to dock up to 30 points for students who did not contribute meaningfully to assignment. Here are some concrete ways/artifacts to show individual contributions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PRs/Commits/Diffs (not only of documents but of supporting elements, boilerplate, ...)</li>
        <li>Decision/Meeting Records with Attribution</li>
        <li>Activity Reports with Attribution</li>
        <li>Changelog Entries for the Doc</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each team member must include at least <strong data-start="2789" data-end="2796">one</strong> verifiable artifact in the submission notes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Align team expectations early so you can move fast without stepping on each other.</li>
    <li>Practice professional communication and ethical team norms you&rsquo;ll use in industry.</li>
    <li>Define quality bars (Definition of Done) that keep your code shippable.</li>
    <li>Document inclusive practices so everyone can contribute effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Must Produce</h2>
<p>Submit the following documents:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Team Charter and Working Agreement</strong> (PDF or Markdown)</li>
    <li><strong>Contribution Guidelines</strong> (Markdown, typically <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Filenames:</strong></p>

<h3>1. Team Charter and Working Agreement</h3>
<p>Create a professional team policy document that defines how you will work together. This document must include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Team Members &amp; Roles:</strong> Specify roles (including leadership/rotation) and responsibilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision-Making Model:</strong> Define how decisions are made (e.g., consent, majority, unanimity).</li>
    <li><strong>Meeting Cadence &amp; Tools:</strong> List meeting times, core tools, and link to your meeting agenda/notes template.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk Management &amp; Escalation Path:</strong> Identify risks and define an escalation path for issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Conflict Resolution &amp; Accountability:</strong> Write a restorative, stepwise plan with triggers, timelines, and how you&rsquo;ll use evidence (PRs, reviews, attendance) to hold each other accountable.</li>
    <li><strong>Definition of Done (DoD) &amp; Quality Gates:</strong> List required checks: tests, code review, security/lint/static analysis, docs updates, and CI gates. Reference the exact CI/lint configs you&rsquo;ll use.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility &amp; Inclusion Practices:</strong> Describe meeting norms (time zones, note-taking, turn-taking), how to request accommodations, and how you&rsquo;ll surface and address barriers.</li>
    <li><strong>Policy Owners &amp; Review Dates:</strong> Add an owner and &ldquo;review-by&rdquo; date to each policy section.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence Links:</strong> Within the charter, provide links to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>CI configuration (e.g., workflow file) and a public link to a successful run log (or a screenshot if the repo is private).</li>
    <li>Linter/formatter config committed to the repo.</li>
    <li>Where tests live and how they&rsquo;re run.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Contribution Guidelines</h3>
<p>Create a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file that lives in your repository. This document should include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>References to your Definition of Done (DoD).</li>
    <li>Code review expectations.</li>
    <li>Commands for running CI, linters, and formatters locally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formatting Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use consistent headings, list actionable steps, and assign an owner and next review date per section.</li>
    <li>Keep links relative where possible; ensure public visibility for graders if using shared docs.</li>
    <li>Keep the charter concise (aim for ~2&ndash;4 pages of focused, scannable content).</li>
    <li><strong>Generative AI may be used for writing.</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> fabricate artifacts, evidence, or data; all examples, metrics, and links must be real.</li>
</ul>
