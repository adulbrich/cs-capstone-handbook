# Assignment Schedule and Improvements

There are mid-term/end-of-term peer review surveys and project partner feedback surveys, every term.

## Improvements

Improvement Ideas:

- Should the assignments in Fall be lower-stakes (at least for the documentation parts)? No resubmission.
- The Winter updates can then be higher-stakes.
- Consolidate assignments to avoid duplicating asessmenet rubrics, e.g., each assignment should focus on different aspects of risk management, the ADR + Code Review should not duplicate what is in the progress reports.

| Assignment | New Structure and Updated Rubrics | Deduplication and Consolidation |
|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Setup | No | No |
| Memo | No | No |
| Research Brief | No | No |
| Progress Reports | Yes | Not sure |
| Team Charter | No | No |
| ADR + Code Review | No | No |
| Retrospective | Yes | No |
| Requirements Update | Yes | Yes |
| Technical Design Update | Yes | Yes |
| Team Charter | No | No |
