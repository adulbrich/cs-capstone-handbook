<p><em>Note:</em> The Change Log is a brief history of <strong>document updates</strong>, not a restatement of all design decisions.</p>
<h3>1. System Context and High-Level Architecture</h3>
<p>Describe how your system fits into its environment and how major pieces fit together.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify external actors (users, services, devices, third-party APIs).</li>
    <li>Show major containers/components and how they interact (e.g., <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://capstone.alexulbrich.com/activities/design/#c4-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C4 level 1&ndash;2 view</a>).</li>
    <li>Name connectors and protocols (HTTP/REST, gRPC, queues, database connections, etc.).</li>
    <li>State boundaries and key deployment assumptions (e.g., cloud/on-prem, major services, data stores).</li>
    <li>Include at least <strong>one architecture diagram</strong> with a figure number, caption, and alt text.</li>
    <li>Ensure the diagram is consistent with your current or planned repo structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Interfaces/APIs and Data Contracts</h3>
<p>Make the key interfaces and contracts explicit.</p>
<ul>
    <li>List the key interfaces/APIs and which components own them.</li>
    <li>Provide contracts (schemas/specs) for important requests, responses, and messages (e.g., OpenAPI, Protobuf, JSON Schema, or clear typed tables).</li>
    <li>Include <strong>example requests/responses</strong> for key endpoints or messages.</li>
    <li>Describe expected error cases and how errors are represented.</li>
    <li>Summarize your approach to <strong>authentication, authorization, and versioning</strong> (paths, headers, tokens, feature flags, etc.).</li>
    <li>Reference any attached schema/spec files from this section.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Component Design and Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Explain how the system is decomposed into components and what each is responsible for.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Define the main components or services in your system and their responsibilities (what each owns and does not own).</li>
    <li>Show how components relate to the interfaces/APIs defined in Section 2 (who calls what, who owns which contracts).</li>
    <li>Describe key dependencies between components and external services (databases, queues, third-party APIs, libraries).</li>
    <li>For each component, note any important performance, scalability, or operational considerations (e.g., expected load, latency sensitivity, scaling strategy).</li>
    <li>For each component, identify <strong>1&ndash;2 component-specific technical or integration risks</strong> (e.g., resource hotspots, fragile integrations, data model churn) and link them to entries in the shared <strong>Technical &amp; Integration Risk Register</strong> in Section 4 (by risk ID, e.g., <code>R-03</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Technical and Integration Risk Register</h3>
<p>Capture the most important <strong>technical and integration risks</strong> and what you will do about them.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide a <strong>risk register table</strong> with at least the following columns: <em>ID, Risk, Impact, Likelihood, Mitigation / Acceptance</em></li>
    <li>Focus on <strong>implementation and architecture risks</strong>, such as performance and scalability, integration with third-party services, tech stack immaturity, data model churn, security/ops, observability, deployment, and rollback risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not re-list pure requirements or stakeholder risks.</strong> Instead, link to the relevant requirements or stakeholder documents where needed.</li>
    <li>Include and re-rank the technical and integration risks contributed by your components (from <strong>Section 3</strong>) so the register reflects a <strong>shared, prioritized view</strong> of system-level technical risk.</li>
    <li>Rank or otherwise indicate relative priority based on impact and likelihood.</li>
    <li>For each risk, give a concise mitigation or acceptance plan.</li>
    <li>Where relevant, reference <strong>requirements, components, or ADRs</strong> that are shaped by this risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Design Decisions and ADR Links</h3>
<p>Show how you document and adopt key design decisions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reference any <strong>Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)</strong> or decision notes relevant to your component and system.</li>
    <li>For each major decision, briefly summarize:
        <ul>
            <li>Context and options considered.</li>
            <li>The decision and primary tradeoffs.</li>
            <li>Important consequences (good and bad).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Include ADR <strong>status</strong> (e.g., proposed, accepted, superseded) where applicable.</li>
    <li>Link to PRs or issues where the decision has been adopted or implemented, if available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formatting Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Keep the main team sections to ~3&ndash;8 pages. Use appendix for supporting information.</li>
    <li>Use clear headings, subheadings, bullets, and descriptive link text.</li>
    <li>Write for a technical stakeholder: be concise, define project-specific terms on first use, and keep terminology consistent across the document.</li>
    <li>Use consistent notation and naming between diagrams, text, and code.</li>
    <li>Give all figures <strong>figure numbers, captions, and alt text</strong>.</li>
    <li>Explain non-obvious notation.</li>
    <li>Ensure diagrams and text are readable when printed or viewed on a laptop screen.</li>
    <li>Ensure a reader can quickly answer: &ldquo;Which part of the system addresses this risk?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where is that decision documented?&rdquo;</li>
    <li><strong>Generative AI may be used for writing.</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> fabricate artifacts, evidence, or data; all examples, metrics, and links must be real.</li>
</ul>
