Interfaces/APIs and data contracts: inventory and coverage		true	5	Exceeds Expectations	Key interfaces/APIs are identified with clear ownership/scope.	4	Meets Expectations	Lists main interfaces but coverage is incomplete.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Interfaces vague or missing.		
Interfaces/APIs and data contracts: contracts and examples		true	6	Exceeds Expectations	Contracts are formal or well-structured (OpenAPI/Proto/JSON Schema) with example requests/responses and common errors.	4.8	Meets Expectations	Basic I/O descriptions and some schema details or examples.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Little schema detail and no useful examples.		
Interfaces/APIs and data contracts: auth, versioning, and error handling		true	4	Exceeds Expectations	Auth and versioning strategy explicit; error handling conventions are clear.	3.2	Meets Expectations	Mentions error handling and either auth or versioning.	0.8	Does Not Meet Expectations	Auth/versioning/error handling omitted.		
Component design and responsibilities: decomposition and responsibilities		true	6	Exceeds Expectations	Clear decomposition into components/services with responsibilities and boundaries.	4.8	Meets Expectations	Main components described but responsibilities/boundaries may be fuzzy.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Component structure unclear or inconsistent.		
Component design and responsibilities: dependencies and ops considerations		true	5	Exceeds Expectations	Shows how components relate to interfaces/APIs and key dependencies; includes performance/scalability/ops considerations.	4	Meets Expectations	Dependencies mentioned; ops considerations are light.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Dependencies/ops largely omitted.		
Component design and responsibilities: component-specific risks linked		true	4	Exceeds Expectations	1–2 technical/integration risks are tied to components and linked to the risk register.	3.2	Meets Expectations	Risks present but loosely tied.	0.8	Does Not Meet Expectations	Risks absent or generic.		
Technical and integration risk register: quantity and specificity		true	5	Exceeds Expectations	Prioritized register with at least five project-specific technical/integration risks.	4	Meets Expectations	At least three relevant risks.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Risk list missing or generic.		
Technical and integration risk register: impact/likelihood and mitigation		true	5	Exceeds Expectations	Each risk includes impact, likelihood, and mitigation/acceptance.	4	Meets Expectations	Basic mitigation exists but impact/likelihood is uneven.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Little impact/likelihood assessment or mitigation.		
Technical and integration risk register: linkage and system-level consolidation		true	4	Exceeds Expectations	Risks consolidated and re-ranked into a system-level view with links to affected requirements/components/ADRs.	3.2	Meets Expectations	Some links exist but consolidation/prioritization is partial.	0.8	Does Not Meet Expectations	No linkage.		
Decisions: decision documentation quality		true	5	Exceeds Expectations	Key decisions documented with clear context and intended outcomes.	4	Meets Expectations	Decisions listed with brief context.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Important decisions undocumented or implied.		
Decisions: alternatives, rationale, and consequences		true	5	Exceeds Expectations	Includes alternatives considered, rationale, and consequences/tradeoffs.	4	Meets Expectations	Some rationale provided; alternatives/tradeoffs light.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Rationale and consequences unclear.		
Decisions: ADR linkage and adoption evidence		true	4	Exceeds Expectations	Links to ADRs/decision notes with clear status and PR/issue links showing adoption.	3.2	Meets Expectations	At least one ADR reference; implementation links partial.	0.8	Does Not Meet Expectations	No ADRs referenced.		
Visual clarity: diagram readability and consistency		true	3	Exceeds Expectations	Diagrams legible and consistently labeled; naming/notation align between diagrams, text, and code.	2.4	Meets Expectations	Diagrams generally readable; minor labeling inconsistencies.	0.6	Does Not Meet Expectations	Diagrams illegible, unlabeled, or missing.		
Traceability: mapping across artifacts		true	5	Exceeds Expectations	Includes traceability aid mapping risks, requirements, components, and ADRs.	4	Meets Expectations	Some traceability exists but is partial.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Little or no traceability.		
Writing: structure and readability		true	5	Exceeds Expectations	Concise, well-structured, polished; uses clear headings and bullets; stays close to the expected core length (~3–8 pages) while still being complete; figures/tables improve skimmability and understanding.	4	Meets Expectations	Mostly clear with some structure; minor readability issues or slightly off-target length.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Hard to read; poorly structured.		
Writing: professionalism and clarity		true	5	Exceeds Expectations	Professional tone; claims are precise and easy to follow; interfaces, risks, and decisions use consistent formatting and are written in verifiable language (reader can tell what is being asserted and what evidence/artifact supports it).	4	Meets Expectations	Generally clear; occasional ambiguity, inconsistent formatting, or awkward wording.	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Unclear or unprofessional tone; inconsistent or confusing formatting and claims.		
Writing: accessibility		true	5	Exceeds Expectations	Figures/tables are legible with short captions; link text is descriptive; private links include lightweight screenshots/snippets so graders can evaluate. (Required architecture diagram alt-text/caption expectations are assessed in the architecture diagram rubric items.)	4	Meets Expectations	Some accessibility practices are used; minor gaps (e.g., missing some captions, vague link text, or limited evidence for private links).	1	Does Not Meet Expectations	Inaccessible formatting or evidence not evaluable (e.g., illegible figures, vague links, or private links with no accessible backup).
